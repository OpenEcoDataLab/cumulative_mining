# Talk overview


- What is the purpose of open science? 

  - Are we achieving this purpose or these purposes?

- Can papers as the foundational form of scholarly communication accomplish these goals? 

  - What alternatives do we have or should we have? 

## Disclaimer

- `r"(raw)"`

- ![](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/here_to_help.png)

- Evan Goldstein helped form, edit, and improve this talk

<!-- - Their are excellent scholars of open science and history of scientific publishing, -->
<!-- I'm not one of them. -->

# Why open science?

- One term, five purposes [Fecher and Friesike 2014](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-00026-8_2)

- <img src = 'open.png' width = '80%'>

## Are we achieving these purposes? 

- COVID-19 response

  <!-- - Public trust in scientists is flat over past ~50 years -->

- Race and racism in the geosciences (Dutt 2019)

  <!-- - Paper publishing is rooted in white, aristocratic, exclusive societies -->

- COVID-19 research and outreach

  <!-- - Publishing lock-in has limited our vision for scholarly communication -->

<!-- which necessarily elevates private property aspect of publishing -->

<!-- chaining scientists and tax-payers to the variation on same models from before.  -->


# Public trust

Data from [General Social Survey](https://gss.norc.org/)


```{r, echo = F}


load('talk/gss_data.RData')
  

ggplot(con_sci_race,aes(x=year,y=percent,color=race)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  theme(legend.position = c(.8,.8))  +
  scale_color_hc(name = '',palette='darkunica') + 
  ylab('People with "a great deal" of trust in scientists') + 
  xlab('Year') + 
  ylim(0,100)



```


## Education correlates with trust


```{r}

ggplot(con_sci_degree %>%
         filter(!is.na(degree)),aes(x=year,y=percent,color=degree)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  theme(legend.position = c(.8,.9))  +
  scale_color_hc(name = '',palette='darkunica') + 
  ylab('People with "a great deal" of trust in scientists') + 
  xlab('Year') + 
  ylim(0,100)


```

<!-- Often it's tempting to blame other institutions for these issues, but 
we can also do better in so many ways-->

# Aristocratic roots

- Original journal *Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London* created in
1665 by Henry Oldenburg

- Motivation: attribution and sharing within elite, Royal Society

- Amazing paper by [Jean-Claude Guedon, 2001](https://arl.secure.nonprofitsoapbox.com/storage/documents/publications/in-oldenburgs-long-shadow.pdf)

##

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/42/Philosophical_Transactions_Volume_1_frontispiece.jpg)

## Oldenburg's long shadow

- `Publishing != Knowledge sharing`

- `Publishing ==  "property rights"`

- `almost.equal(1665_publishing,2020_publishing)`

## Publishing's history helps create our exclusionary present

-![](racism_geo.png)

- [Inefuku and Roh 2016](https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/FvnwDAAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PA107) 

- Why not change?
<!-- compellingly argue that the publishing industry itself -->
<!-- has not broken free of it's racist and sexist past and act as
a direct impediment to minoritized peoples-->
<!-- - Systemic racism within and outside of academia -->

# Publishing lock-in

- From hiring and T&P perspective, `value(scientist) = publishing + grants`

- Many top-tier journals are old and venerable and... run by private for-profit
companies

- But we all publish there because most immediate/necessary way to help our careers


## Consequences of publishing lock-in 

- The traditional (pdf-like) paper is primal

  - Not the best way to reach broad audience
  
  - Well-suited to ceding control to for-profit publishers
  
  - Wildly limiting compared to other approaches

- ~ $10 billion in profit for publishing companies [Aspeti et al., 2019](https://infrastructure.sparcopen.org/landscape-analysis)

##

## More consequences

- Closed peer-review allows for biased, sexist, racist, exclusionary 'reviews' with little or no consequences to perpetrators 

- Open access does not solve capitalist or pdf-primacy issues

- Shifting model to researchers paying for open access creates...

# Can we achieve open science goals with pdfs as primary output?

- Video abstracts

- Plain language summaries

- Key points

- Science journalism

# Preprints

- Still traditional paper focus but

  - Removes traditional peer-review barrier
  
  - Increases speed to publishing and pace of science
  
  - Can cleanly and immediately solve open acces issues [Sever et al., 2019](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000273)
  
  - Requires training ourselves and society to understand what preprints are and aren't

# More SciComm?

- <iframe width="600" height="100" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YI3tsmFsrOg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

- Radiolab, The Last Archive etc...

- Yes! but also...

<!-- SciComm is still outside of traditionally valued research output -->
<!-- Requires significant work to produce both paper and scicomm -->
<!-- Relies on intermediaries to communicate results with mixed effect -->

# Peer-reviewed public engagement?

- Where are the people we want to reach?

- Are we producing content on these platforms?

- Is this content valued, supported, and primary (not supportive or dependent on pdf paper)?

- Do we as scientists always need to read a paper to understand an idea? 

- Would other content platforms help us understand more ideas? more quickly?

# And more!

- These formats will connect scientists to people in more direct and transparent ways

- They will also make our science easier to understand for ourselves

- And escape some traditional publishing problems

# Conclusions

- Science and open science needs more public facing scholarly communication

- The paper is great, but limited, and deserves some 
competition from other forms

- These new forms may help alleviate some of the
isolated, exclusionary, and capitalist problems associated with modern peer-review publishing

- Wanna make something new and weird? Let me know!
