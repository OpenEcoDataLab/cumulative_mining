# Talk overview


- What is the purpose of open science? 

  - Are we achieving this purpose or these purposes?

- Can papers as the foundational form of scholarly communication accomplish 
these goals? 

  - What alternatives do we have or should we have? 

## Disclaimer

- These are raw ideas, partially (mostly?) intended to provoke conversation

- ![](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/here_to_help.png)

- Evan Goldstein helped form, edit, and improve this talk

<!-- - Their are excellent scholars of open science and history of scientific publishing, -->
<!-- I'm not one of them. -->

# Why open science?

- One term, five purposes [Fecher and Friesike 2014](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-00026-8_2)

- ![](open.png)

# Are we achieving these purposes? 

- COVID-19 response

  - Public trust in scientists is flat over past ~50 years

-   Race and racism in the geosciences (Dutt 2019)

  -   Paper publishing is rooted in white, aristocratic, exclusive societies

- COVID-19 research and outreach

  - Publishing lock-in has limited our vision of scholarly communication

<!-- which necessarily elevates private property aspect of publishing -->

<!-- chaining scientists and tax-payers to the variation on same models from before.  -->

## Public trust

Data from [General Social Survey](https://gss.norc.org/)


```{r, echo = F}


load('talk/gss_data.RData')
  

ggplot(con_sci_race,aes(x=year,y=percent,color=race)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  theme(legend.position = c(.8,.8))  +
  scale_color_hc(name = '',palette='darkunica') + 
  ylab('People with "a great deal" of trust in scientists') + 
  xlab('Year') + 
  ylim(0,100)



```


## Education correlates with trust


```{r}

ggplot(con_sci_degree %>%
         filter(!is.na(degree)),aes(x=year,y=percent,color=degree)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  theme(legend.position = c(.8,.9))  +
  scale_color_hc(name = '',palette='darkunica') + 
  ylab('People with "a great deal" of trust in scientists') + 
  xlab('Year') + 
  ylim(0,100)


```

<!-- Often it's tempting to blame other institutions for these issues, but 
we can also do better in so many ways-->

# Aristocratic roots

- Original journal *Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London* created in
1665 by Henry Oldenburg

- Motivation: attribution and sharing within elite Royal Society

- Amazing paper by [Jean-Claude Guedon 2001](https://arl.secure.nonprofitsoapbox.com/storage/documents/publications/in-oldenburgs-long-shadow.pdf)

## Oldenburg's long shadow

- Guedon argues original publishing design not really aimed at sharing knowledge

- Rather, primarily aimed at copyright and idea "property rights"

- For the most part we're still stuck in this mode with serious consequences

## Publishing's history helps create our exclusionary present

-![](racism_geo.png)

- [Inefuku and Roh 2016](https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/FvnwDAAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PA107) 
- Why not change?
<!-- compellingly argue that the publishing industry itself -->
<!-- has not broken free of it's racist and sexist past and act as
a direct impediment to minoritized peoples-->
<!-- - Systemic racism within and outside of academia -->

# Publishing lock-in

- From hiring and T&P perspective, scientist = publishing and grants

- Many top-tier journals are old and venerable and... run by private for-profit
companies

- But we all publish there because most immediate/necessary way to help our careers


## Consequences of publishing lock-in 

- The traditional (pdf-like) paper is primal
  - Not the best way to reach broad audience
  - Well-suited to ceding control to for-profit publishers

- ~ $10 billion in profit for publishing companies [Aspeti et al., 2019](https://infrastructure.sparcopen.org/landscape-analysis)

- ![](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/peer_review_2x.png)


## More consequences

- Closed peer-review allows for sexist, racist, exclusionary commentary with no 
consequences to perpetrators 

- Open access does not solve capitalist or pdf-primacy issues

- Shifting model to researchers paying for open access creates...

# Preprints

- Still traditional paper focus but

  - Removes traditional peer-review barrier
  
  - Increases speed to publishing and consequent feedback
  
  - PLOS BIO Plan U (take some major points)

# Peer-reviewed public engagement?

- Where are the people we want to reach?

- Are we producing content on these platforms?

- Is this content valued, supported, and primary (not supportive or dependent on pdf paper)?

- Do we as scientists always need to read a paper to understand an idea? 

- Would other content platforms help us understand more? more quickly?

## And more things I haven't thought of

- These formats will connect scientists to people in more direct and transparent ways

- They will also make our science easier to understand for ourselves

- And escape traditional publishing problems
