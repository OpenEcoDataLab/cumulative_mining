These impacts are well-documented in the literature (Bernhardt and Palmer 2011), but most of these analyses linking mining to downstream impacts relied on relatively coarse temporal and spatial resolution maps of mining extent (Bernhardt et al. 2012) or datasets that were collected ad-hoc for each research paper (Lindberg et al. 2011). This problem of disaggregated and coarse mining coverage maps was fixed by Pericack and others who used Google Earth Engine to delineate active mining extent coverages for every year from 1985-2015 (Pericak et al. 2018). This new dataset is an excellent starting point to better understand the impacts of mountaintop mining "]
