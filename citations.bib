abstract = {Surface mining for coal has taken place in the Central Appalachian region of the United States for well over a century, with a notable increase since the 1970s. Researchers have quantified the ecosystem and health impacts stemming from mining, relying in part on a geospatial dataset defining surface mining's extent at a decadal interval. This dataset, however, does not deliver the temporal resolution necessary to support research that could establish causal links between mining activity and environmental or public health and safety outcomes, nor has it been updated since 2005. Here we use Google Earth Engine and Landsat imagery to map the yearly extent of surface coal mining in Central Appalachia from 1985 through 2015, making our processing models and output data publicly available. We find that 2,900 km2 of land has been newly mined over this 31-year period. Adding this more-recent mining to surface mines constructed prior to 1985, we calculate a cumulative mining footprint of 5,900 km2. Over the study period, correlating active mine area with historical surface mine coal production shows that each metric ton of coal is associated with 12 m2 of actively mined land. Our automated, open-source model can be regularly updated as new surface mining occurs in the region and can be refined to capture mining reclamation activity into the future. We freely and openly offer the data for use in a range of environmental, health, and economic studies; moreover, we demonstrate the capability of using tools like Earth Engine to analyze years of remotely sensed imagery over spatially large areas to quantify land use change.},

abstract = {Freshwater ecosystems underpin global water and food security, yet are some of the most endangered ecosystems in the world because they are particularly vulnerable to land management change and climate variability. The US National Research Council's guidance to NASA regarding missions for the coming decade includes a polar orbiting, global mapping hyperspectral satellite remote sensing mission, the Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI), to make quantitative measurements of ecosystem change. Traditionally, freshwater ecosystems have been challenging to measure with satellite remote sensing because they are small and spatially complex, require high fidelity spectroradiometry, and are best described with biophysical variables derived from high spectral resolution data. In this study, we evaluate the contribution of a hyperspectral global mapping satellite mission to measuring freshwater ecosystems. We demonstrate the need for such a mission, and evaluate the suitability and gaps, through an examination of the measurement resolution issues impacting freshwater ecosystem measurements (spatial, temporal, spectral and radiometric). These are exemplified through three case studies that use remote sensing to characterize a component of freshwater ecosystems that drive primary productivity. The high radiometric quality proposed for the HyspIRI mission makes it uniquely well designed for measuring freshwater ecosystems accurately at moderate to high spatial resolutions. The spatial and spectral resolutions of the HyspIRI mission are well suited for the retrieval of multiple biophysical variables, such as phycocyanin and chlorophyll-a. The effective temporal resolution is suitable for characterizing growing season wetland phenology in temperate regions, but may not be appropriate for tracking algal bloom dynamics, or ecosystem responses to extreme events in monsoonal regions. Global mapping missions provide the systematic, repeated measurements necessary to measure the drivers of freshwater biodiversity change. Archival global mapping missions with open access and free data policies increase end user uptake globally. Overall, an archival, hyperspectral global mapping mission uniquely meets the measurement requirements of multiple end users for freshwater ecosystem science and management.},

abstract = {Abstract. The use of ground sampled water quality information for global studies is limited due to practical and financial constraints. Remote sensing is a valuable means to overcome such limitations and to provide synoptic views of ambient water quality at appropriate spatio-temporal scales. In past years several large data processing efforts were initiated to provide corresponding data sources. The Diversity II water quality dataset consists of several monthly, yearly and 9-year averaged water quality parameters for 340 lakes worldwide and is based on data from the full ENVISAT MERIS operation period (2002–2012). Existing retrieval methods and datasets were selected after an extensive algorithm intercomparison exercise. Chlorophyll-a, total suspended matter, turbidity, coloured dissolved organic matter, lake surface water temperature, cyanobacteria and floating vegetation maps, as well as several auxiliary data layers, provide a generically specified database that can be used for assessing a variety of locally relevant ecosystem properties and environmental problems. For validation and accuracy assessment, we provide matchup comparisons for 24 lakes and a group of reservoirs representing a wide range of bio-optical conditions. Matchup comparisons for chlorophyll-a concentrations indicate mean absolute errors and bias in the order of median concentrations for individual lakes, while total suspended matter and turbidity retrieval achieve significantly better performance metrics across several lake-specific datasets. We demonstrate the use of the products by illustrating and discussing remotely sensed evidence of lake-specific processes and prominent regime shifts documented in the literature. The Diversity II data are available from https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.871462, and Python scripts for their analysis and visualization are provided at https://github.com/odermatt/diversity/.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The absorption spectra relative to distilled water of samples from various inland and coastal waters in south-eastern Australia (New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory) have been measured. Amongst the freshwater samples the level of dissolved yellow substance (gelbstoff) was found to vary seven-fold (the base-10 logarithm absorption coefficient at 440 nm ranged from 0.42 to 2.90 m-1). In coastal sea water the concentration was much lower than in any of the freshwater samples (absorption coefficient 0.01-0.08 m-1 at 440 nm). Calculations have been carried out of the contribution made by yellow substance to attenuation of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). In the inland waters yellow substance has a dominating influence on light attenuation, reducing the amount of PAR many-fold, and the blue region of the spectrum is abolished at quite moderate depths. In all cases except sea water it was calculated that most (60-80{\%}) of the quanta captured are absorbed by yellow substance rather than by water. An alternative name, 'gilvin' (Latin, gilvus = pale yellow), for the yellow pigments in natural waters, to replace 'yellow substance' or 'gelbstoff ', is suggested.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Our objective was to compare the leaching of dissolved organic and inorganic nutrients in cut and mature forest stands and to develop hypotheses about factors controlling the retention of soluble organic nutrients after disturbance. Solution chemistry was measured for 2 yr after clearcutting a small area in the surrounding undisturbed deciduous forest on a reference watershed at the Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory in the Appalachian Mountains. Concentrations of dissolved organic C (DOC) and N (DON) in slash leachate were 2.6 to 3.2 times the concentrations in throughfall from undisturbed forest. Concentrations in forest poor, A horizon, and B horizon solutions from cut plots were 1.1 to 3.8 times those from undisturbed forest. Dissolved organic P (DOP) concentrations in cut plots were 3.1 and 3.6 times those of uncut plots in solutions from slash and forest floor, respectively, but did not differ in mineral soil. Fluxes of DOG, DON, and DOP in all strata were greater in cut plots than uncut plots. Fluxes of DON were greater than those of ammonium plus nitrate N in all strata of both cut and uncut plots. We hypothesize that the well-recognized retention mechanisms for inorganic nutrients combine with equilibrium adsorption of dissolved organic matter to efficiently buffer against leaching of both soluble inorganic and organic nutrients after clearcutting.},

This review thus examined about 312 watersheds worldwide to provide a generalized framework to evaluate hydrological responses to forest cover change and to identify the contribution of spatial scale, climate, forest type and hydrological regime in determining the intensity of forest change related hydrological responses in small ({\textless}1000 km2) and large watersheds (⩾1000 km2). Key findings include: (1) the increase in annual runoff associated with forest cover loss is statistically significant at multiple spatial scales whereas the effect of forest cover gain is statistically inconsistent; (2) the sensitivity of annual runoff to forest cover change tends to attenuate as watershed size increases only in large watersheds; (3) annual runoff is more sensitive to forest cover change in water-limited watersheds than in energy-limited watersheds across all spatial scales; and (4) small mixed forest-dominated watersheds or large snow-dominated watersheds are more hydrologically resilient to forest cover change. These findings improve the understanding of hydrological response to forest cover change at different spatial scales and provide a scientific underpinning to future watershed management in the context of climate change and increasing anthropogenic disturbances.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York. The phrase “hot spots and hot moments” first entered the lexicon in 2003, following the publication of the paper “Biogeochemical hot spots and hot moments at the interface of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems” by McClain and others (Ecosystems 6:301–312, 2003). This paper described the potential for rare places and rare events to exert a disproportionate influence on the movement of elements at the scale of landscapes and ecosystems. Here, we examine how the cleverly named hot spot and hot moment concept (hereafter HSHM) has influenced biogeochemistry and ecosystem science over the last 13 years. We specifically examined the extent to which the HSHM concept has: (1) motivated research aimed at understanding how and why biogeochemical behavior varies across spatiotemporal scales; (2) improved our ability to detect HSHM phenomena; and (3) influenced our approaches to restoration and ecosystem management practices. We found that the HSHM concept has provided a highly fertile framework for a substantial volume of research on the spatial and temporal dynamics of nutrient cycling, and in doing so, has improved our understanding of when and where biogeochemical rates are maximized. Despite the high usage of the term, we found limited examples of rigorous statistical or modeling approaches that would allow ecosystem scientists to not only identify, but scale the aggregate impact of HSHM on ecosystem processes. We propose that the phrase “hot spots and hot moments” includes two implicit assumptions that may actually be limiting progress in applying the concept. First, by differentiating “hot spots” from “hot moments,” the phrase separates the spatial and temporal components of biogeochemical behavior. Instead, we argue that the temporal dynamics of a putative hot spot are a fundamental trait that should be used in their description. Second, the adjective “hot” implicitly suggests that a place or a time must be dichotomously classified as “hot or not.” We suggest instead that each landscape of interest contains a wide range of biogeochemical process rates that respond to critical drivers, and the gradations of this biogeochemical topography are of greater interest than the maximum peaks. For these reasons, we recommend replacing the HSHM terminology with the more nuanced term ecosystem control points. “Ecosystem control” suggests that the rate must be of sufficient magnitude or ubiquity to affect dynamics of the {\ldots}},

Analysis of soils from lysimeter study sites at La Selva, Costa Rica, and Thompson Site, Washington produced similar results. In laboratory adsorption studies, only soils from Coweeta retained substantial (50 to 100{\%}) additional amounts of sulfate in insoluble forms. Soil adsorbed sulfate content and sulfate adsorption capacity were positively correlated with sesquioxide content but negatively correlated with organic matter content. Organic matter apparently blocks sesquioxide adsorption sites, preventing sulfate adsorption in sesquioxide-rich A horizons and Spodosol B2ir horizons. This blockage may account for the accummulation of adsorbed sulfate in B horizons in temperate and tropical soils and the susceptibility of New England Spodosols to leaching by H2SO4.},

Here we investigate the changes in risk of great floods-that is, floods with discharges exceeding 100- year levels from basins larger than 200,000 km(2)-using both streamflow measurements and numerical simulations of the anthropogenic climate change associated with greenhouse gases and direct radiative effects of sulphate aerosols(6). We find that the frequency of great floods increased substantially during the twentieth century. The recent emergence of a statistically significant positive trend in risk of great floods is consistent with results from the climate model, and the model suggests that the trend will continue.},

abstract = {Soil net nitrogen mineralization and nitrification rates were studied on nine undisturbed, forested watersheds in an effort to explain large variations in nitrate export in streamflow within the mid-Appalachian region. Rates of soil net nitrogen mineralization and net nitrification were measured in the upper 10 cm of mineral soil over a 5-week summer incubation period (June-July) using nine buried bags in each of the three major soil types on each watershed. Watersheds with high, medium, and low nitrate export rates exhibited high, medium, and low mean net nitrogen mineralization and net nitrification rates, respectively. Exchangeable calcium (an index to site fertility), CM ratios, and soil moisture content together explained 63{\%} of the variation in soil nitrogen mineralization rates, and exchangeable calcium and soil moisture content explained 61{\%} of the variation in soil nitrification rates using multiple regression analysis. The variation in watershed nitrate export was best explained by total nitrogen in the upper 10 cm of mineral soil (explained 46{\%}) and the percentage of mineralization due to nitrification (explained 42{\%}). Estimated rates of wet and dry atmospheric deposition of nitrogen were not significantly correlated with watershed nitrate export. Results from this study demonstrate that soil nitrogen pools and dynamics are the most critical factors controlling nitrate export from forested watersheds in the mid-Appalachians. Long-term changes in site fertility, C/N ratios, and soil moisture, which largely control microbial nitrogen cycling, should have a significant effect on long-term trends in nitrate leaching.},

Common among all environments is that hydrological transitions, either episodic changes in water availability or hydrologic transport of reactants, result in disproportionately high rates of C and N cycling. Two major research challenges in coupling hydrological and biogeochemical research are (a) effectively scaling reactions at these spatiotemporal transitions and (b) combining the progress made within each of the five environments listed above into an integrated understanding of hydrobiogeochemical cycles. Changes in local-to-regional hydrological cycling are likely to result in unexpected surprises at the landscape scale until progress in these research areas is made.},

Hydrologic modeling directed at quantifying these potential changes has focused on the magnitude and timing of spring snowmelt as the key control on the spatial-temporal pattern of summer streamflow. We illustrate how spatial differences in groundwater dynamics can also play a significant role in determining streamflow responses to warming. We examine two contrasting watersheds, one located in the Western Cascades and the other in the High Cascades mountains of Oregon. We use both empirical analysis of streamflow data and physically based, spatially distributed modeling to disentangle the relative importance of multiple and interacting controls. In particular, we explore the extent to which differences in snow accumulation and melt and drainage characteristics (deep ground water vs. shallow subsurface) mediate the effect of climate change. Results show that within the Cascade Range, local variations in bedrock geology and concomitant differences in volume and seasonal fluxes of subsurface water will likely result in significant spatial variability in responses to climate forcing. Specifically, watersheds dominated by High Cascade geology will show greater absolute reductions in summer streamflow with predicted temperature increases.},

abstract = {AbstractSouthwestern North America (SWNA) is projected to become drier in the 21st century as both precipitation (P) and evaporation (E) rates change with increasing greenhouse gas concentration. We diagnose the relative contributions of changes in P and E to the local surface moisture balance (P–E) in cold and warm halves of the year across SWNA. Trends in P-E vary spatially between the arid southern subregion (mostly Northern Mexico) and the more temperate northern subregion (Southwest US), although both subregions exhibit a negative trend in P–E (trending toward more arid conditions) in CMIP5 projections for the 21st century. The P-E trend is biggest in the cold season, when much of the base flow to rivers in the Southwest US is generated. The downward trend in cold season P–E across SWNA is caused primarily by increasing E in the North, and by decreasing P in the South. Decreasing P is the primary contributor to modest warm season drying trends in both northern and southern subregions. P accounts for ...},

But because-by definition-extreme events are rare, it is significantly more difficult to quantify the risk of extremes. Ensemble-based probabilistic predictions(2), as used in short- and medium-term forecasts of weather and climate, are more useful than deterministic forecasts using a 'best guess' scenario to address this sort of problem(3,4). Here we present a probabilistic analysis of 19 global climate model simulations with a generic binary decision model. We estimate that the probability of total boreal winter precipitation exceeding two standard deviations above normal will increase by a factor of five over parts of the UK over the next 100 years. We find similar increases in probability for the Asian monsoon region in boreal summer, with implications for flooding in Bangladesh. Further practical applications of our techniques would be helped by the use of larger ensembles (for a more complete sampling of model uncertainty) and a wider range of scenarios at a resolution adequate to analyse average-size river basins.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved. Considerable variability in the seasonal patterns of stream water nitrate (NO3-) has been observed in forested watersheds throughout the world. While many forested headwater catchments exhibit winter and early spring peaks in NO3- concentrations, several watersheds have peak concentrations during the summer months. Pond Branch, a headwater catchment in Maryland monitored for over 10 years, exhibits recurrent and broad summer peaks in both NO3- concentrations and watershed export. Higher NO3- export from June to September is particularly surprising, given that these summer months typically have the year's lowest discharge. A key challenge is identifying the source(s) of NO3- and the mechanism(s) by which it is transported to the watershed outlet during the summer. In this study, we assessed multiple hypotheses (not mutually exclusive) that could account for the seasonal trend including proximal controls of groundwater-surface water interactions, instream processes, and riparian groundwater-N cycling interactions, as well as two distal controls: geochemical weathering and senescence of riparian vegetation. A combination of long-term weekly and limited duration high-frequency sensor data reveals the importance of riparian ecohydrologic processes during base flow. In this watershed, patterns of seasonal stream water NO3- concentrations and fluxes depend fundamentally on interactions between groundwater dynamics and nitrogen (N) cycling in the riparian zone. Groundwater tables control nitrification-denitrification dynamics as well as hydrologic transport. Our results suggest that in many watersheds, a more sophisticated exploration of NO3- production and NO3- transport mechanisms is required to identify critical points in the landscape and over time that disproportionately drive patterns of watershed NO3- export. Key Points: Mass flux of nitrate peaks during summer when discharge is lowest Riparian zone processes drive the seasonality of catchment scale nitrate export Water table fluctuations couple ET to soil redox and N cycling and transport},

Nevertheless, the ability to generalize these findings to ungauged regions remains out of reach. In spite of their apparent physical basis and complexity, the current generation of detailed models is process weak. Their representations of the internal states and process dynamics are still at odds with many experimental findings. In order to make continued progress in watershed hydrology and to bring greater coherence to the science, we need to move beyond the status quo of having to explicitly characterize or prescribe landscape heterogeneity in our (highly calibrated) models and in this way reproduce process complexity and instead explore the set of organizing principles that might underlie the heterogeneity and complexity.

Understanding climate change demands attention to changes in climate variability and extremes1, but knowledge of the recent behaviour of these variables has been limited by the unavailability of long-term high-resolution data. Climate simulations incorporating increased greenhouse-gas concentrations2-9 indicate that a warmer climate could result in a decrease in high-frequency temperature variability (analogous to the decrease in variability observed from the poles to the tropics, and from winter to summer10) and an increase in the proportion of precipitation occurring in extreme events. Here we analyse high-frequency temperature and precipitation data from hundreds of sites spread over Australia, China, the former Soviet Union and the United States over the past 30 to 80 years. Day-to-day temperature variability is seen to have decreased in the Northern Hemisphere, and-at least within the United States-the proportion of total precipitation contributed by extreme, one-day events has increased significantly. We find that although the notion of a recent increase in interannual temperature variability is supported by data from the past few decades11, the longer data records indicate that this trend is an aberration.},

Although big-data approaches are not a panacea, there are large-scale environmental questions for which big data are well suited, even necessary. Ecosystems are complex biophysical systems that are not easily defined by any one data type, location, or time. Understanding complex ecosystem properties is data intensive along axes of volume (size of data), velocity (frequency of data), and variety (diversity of data types). Ecosystem scientists have employed impressive technology for generating high-frequency, large-volume data streams. Yet important challenges remain in both theoretical and infrastructural development to support visualization and analysis of large and diverse data. The way forward includes greater support for network science approaches, and for development of big-data infrastructure that includes capacity for visualization and analysis of integrated data products.

abstract = {We report the effects of deforestation on the export of particulate matter, erodibility of the ecosystem, and the relative importance of dissolved substances and particulate matter in exported materials. The mature forested ecosystem is little affected by erosion, with an average annual particulate matter export of only 2.5 MT (metric tons) km{\^{}}-{\^{}}2 yr{\^{}}-{\^{}}1. Deforestation and repression of growth for 3 yr increased export to a maximum of 38 MT km{\^{}}-{\^{}}2 yr{\^{}}-{\^{}}1, but the increase in export was exponential with rather minor increases in the first 2 yr after cutting and a sharp increase in the 3rd yr. This resulted because the ecosystem continued to exercise considerable control over erodibility for 2 yr after cutting without annual renewal of biotic regulation by primary productivity. Increases in particulate matter export are primarily due to increases in erodibility rather than increased flow rates. In the mature ecosystem, the average ratio of annual net export of dissolved substance to particulate matter is 2.3. Deforestation shifts this ratio to {\textgreater}8.0 during the first 2 yr after cutting. This shift results because the export trends, for dissolved substances and particulate matter following deforestation, are not synchronous. The first response to deforestation is mobilization of nutrients from the available nutrient and organic matter compartments and leakage in stream water. After 2 yr, particulate matter output rises sharply as biotic control of erodibility weakens, while dissolved substance export declines, probably because of diminution of readily available nutrients stored within the system. This nonsynchrony, coupled with the action of natural species adapted to take advantage of the abundance of nutrients and water that results immediately after disturbance, may be considered as part of a homeostatic mechanism that allows rapid recovery of a forest ecosystem while minimizing the effects of erosion. Thus, following destruction of the vegetation, the ecosystem maintains a residual resistance to erosion and has a high potential for repair through successional productivity. Nutrient flux and erosion losses return to previous levels as the intrasystem aspects of the hydrologic-nutrient cycle interaction and erodibility are increasingly regulated by biotic factors. These results relative to stable conditions and their reestablishment following disturbance may have applicability to a wide range of terrestrial ecosystems.},

In the Colorado River Basin, the early 21st century drought has been the most extreme in over a century of Colorado River flows, and might occur in any given century with probability of only 60{\%}. However, hydrological model runs from downscaled Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment climate change simulations suggest that the region is likely to become drier and experience more severe droughts than this. In the latter half of the 21st century the models produced considerably greater drought activity, parti-cularly in the Colorado River Basin, as judged from soil moisture anomalies and other hydrological measures. As in the historical record, most of the simulated extreme droughts build up and per-sist over many years. Durations of depleted soil moisture over the historical record ranged from 4 to 10 years, but in the 21st century simulations, some of the dry events persisted for 12 years or more. Summers during the observed early 21st century drought were re-markably warm, a feature also evident in many simulated droughts of the 21st century. These severe future droughts are aggravated by enhanced, globally warmed temperatures that reduce spring snowpack and late spring and summer soil moisture. As the climate continues to warm and soil moisture deficits accumulate beyond historical levels, the model simulations suggest that sustaining water supplies in parts of the Southwest will be a challenge. climate change ∣ regional modeling ∣ sustainability ∣ water resources P ersistent dry conditions have generally prevailed in the South-west during the early years of the 21st century (1), after wetter than normal conditions in the preceding years.

The spatial variations among basins over the CONUS are discussed and compared using a series of maps.

Statistical analyses were employed to determine differences between baseflow and stormflow chemistry, and relate basin-scale factors governing local chemical processes to stream chemistry. Following precipitation events, stream pH was reduced and aluminium concentrations increased, while the response of acid neutralizing capacity (ANC), nitrate, sulfate, and base cations varied. Several basin characteristics were highly correlated with each other, demonstrating the interrelatedness of topographical, geological, soil, and vegetative parameters. These interrelated basin factors uniquely influenced acidification response in these streams. Streams in higher-elevation basins ({\textgreater}975 m) had significantly lower pH, ANC, sodium, and silicon and higher nitrate concentrations (p{\textless}0.05). Streams in smaller basins ({\textless}10km2) had significantly lower nitrate, sodium, magnesium, silicon, and base cation concentrations. In stormflow, streams in basins with Anakeesta geology ({\textgreater}10{\%}) had significantly lower pH and sodium concentrations, and higher aluminium concentrations. Chemical and physical soil characteristics and dominant overstory vegetation in basins were more strongly correlated with baseflow and stormflow chemical constituents than topographical and geological basin factors. Saturated hydraulic conductivity, of all the soil parameters, was most related to concentrations of stormflow constituents. Basins with higher average hydraulic conductivities were associated with lower stream pH, ANC, and base cation concentrations, and higher nitrate and sulfate concentrations. These results emphasize the importance of soil and geological properties influencing stream chemistry and promote the prioritization of management strategies for aquatic resources.},

abstract = {Traditional biogeochemicaI theories suggest that ecosystem nitrogen retention is controlled by biotic N limitation, that stream N losses should increase with successional age, and that increasing N deposition will accelerate this process. These theories ignore the role of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) as a mechanism of N loss. We examined patterns of organic and inorganic N export from sets of old-growth and historically (80-110 years ago) logged and burned watersheds in the northeastern US, a region of moderate, elevated N deposition. Stream nitrate concentrations were strongly seasonal, and mean (+/- SD) nitrate export from old-growth watersheds (1.4 +/- 0.6 kg N ha(-1) y(-1)) was four times greater than from disturbed watersheds (0.3 +/- 0.3 kg N ha(-1) y(-1)), suggesting that biotic control over nitrate loss can persist for a century. DON loss averaged 0.7 (+/- 0.2) kg N ha(-1) y(-1) and accounted for 28-87{\%} of total dissolved N (TDN) export. DON concentrations did not vary seasonally or with successional status, but correlated with dissolved organic carbon (DOC), which varied inversely with hardwood forest cover. The patterns of DON loss did not follow expected differences in biotic N demand but instead were consistent with expected differences in DOC production and sorption. Despite decades of moderate N deposition, TDN export was low, and even old-growth forests retained at least 65{\%} of N inputs. The reasons for this high N retention are unclear: if due to a large capacity for N storage or biological removal, N saturation may require several decades to occur; if due to interannual climate variability, large losses of nitrate may occur much sooner.},

abstract = {Changes in several components of the hydrological cycle over the contiguous United States have been docu- mented during the twentieth century: an increase of precipitation, especially heavy and very heavy precipitation, and a significant retreat in spring snow cover extent over western regions during the last few decades. These changes have affected streamflow, including the probability of high flow. In the eastern half of the United States a significant relationship is found between the frequency of heavy pre- cipitation and high streamflow events both annually and during the months of maximum streamflow. Two factors contributed to finding such a relation: 1) the relatively small contribution of snowmelt to heavy runoff in the eastern United States (compared to the west), and 2) the presence of a sufficiently dense network of streamflow and precipi- tation gauges available for analysis. An increase of spring heavy precipitation events over the eastern United States indicates with high probability that during the twentieth century an increase of high streamflow conditions has also occurred. In the West, a statistically significant reduction of snow cover extent has complicated the relation between heavy precipitation and streamflow. Increases in peak stream flow have not been observed here, despite increases in heavy precipitation events, and less extensive snow cover is the likely cause.},

abstract = {Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain recent, widespread increases in concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the surface waters of glaciated landscapes across eastern North America and northern and central Europe. Some invoke anthropogenic forcing through mechanisms related to climate change, nitrogen deposition or changes in land use, and by implication suggest that current concentrations and fluxes are without precedent. All of these hypotheses imply that DOC levels will continue to rise, with unpredictable consequences for the global carbon cycle. Alternatively, it has been proposed that DOC concentrations are returning toward pre-industrial levels as a result of a gradual decline in the sulphate content of atmospheric deposition. Here we show, through the assessment of time series data from 522 remote lakes and streams in North America and northern Europe, that rising trends in DOC between 1990 and 2004 can be concisely explained by a simple model based solely on changes in deposition chemistry and catchment acid-sensitivity. We demonstrate that DOC concentrations have increased in proportion to the rates at which atmospherically deposited anthropogenic sulphur and sea salt have declined. We conclude that acid deposition to these ecosystems has been partially buffered by changes in organic acidity and that the rise in DOC is integral to recovery from acidification. Over recent decades, deposition-driven increases in organic matter solubility may have increased the export of DOC to the oceans, a potentially important component of regional carbon balances. The increase in DOC concentrations in these regions appears unrelated to other climatic factors.},

Additions of N and S are approximately twice the ambient deposition of nitrogen and sulfur in the adjacent mature forested watershed (WS4), that serves as the reference watershed for this study. Acidification of stream water and soil solution was documented, although the response was delayed, and acidification processes appeared to be driven by nitrate rather than sulfate. As a result of the acidification treatment, nitrate solution concentrations increased below all soil layers, whereas sulfate was retained by all soil layers after only a few years of the fertilization treatments, perhaps due to adsorption induced from decreasing sulfate deposition. Based on soil solution monitoring, depletion of calcium and magnesium was observed, first from the upper soil horizons and later from the lower soil horizons. Increased base cation concen- trations in stream water also were documented and linked closely with high solution levels of nitrate.Significant changes in soil chemical properties were not detected after 12 years of treatment, however.},

abstract = {Water fluxes in catchments are controlled by physical processes and material properties that are complex, heterogeneous, and poorly characterized by direct measurement. As a result, parsimonious theories of catchment hydrology remain elusive. Here I describe how one class of catchments (those in which discharge is determined by the volume of water in storage) can be characterized as simple first-order nonlinear dynamical systems, and I show that the form of their governing equations can be inferred directly from measurements of streamflow fluctuations. I illustrate this approach using data from the headwaters of the Severn and Wye rivers at Plynlimon in mid-Wales. This approach leads to quantitative estimates of catchment dynamic storage, recession time scales, and sensitivity to antecedent moisture, suggesting that it is useful for catchment characterization. It also yields a first-order nonlinear differential equation that can be used to directly simulate the streamflow hydrograph from precipitation and evapotranspiration time series. This single-equation rainfall-runoff model predicts streamflow at Plynlimon as accurately as other models that are much more highly parameterized. It can also be analytically inverted; thus, it can be used to {\&}{\#}8220;do hydrology backward,{\&}{\#}8221; that is, to infer time series of whole-catchment precipitation directly from fluctuations in streamflow. At Plynlimon, precipitation rates inferred from streamflow fluctuations agree with rain gauge measurements as closely as two rain gauges in each catchment agree with each other. These inferred precipitation rates are not calibrated to precipitation measurements in any way, making them a strong test of the underlying theory. The same approach can be used to estimate whole-catchment evapotranspiration rates during rainless periods. At Plynlimon, evapotranspiration rates inferred from streamflow fluctuations exhibit seasonal and diurnal cycles that agree semiquantitatively with Penman-Monteith estimates. Thus, streamflow hydrographs may be useful for reconstructing precipitation and evapotranspiration records where direct measurements are unavailable, unreliable, or unrepresentative at the scale of the landscape.},

abstract = {In ungauged basins, predicting streamflows is a major challenge for hydrologists and water managers, with approaches needed to systematically generalize hydrometric properties from limited stream gauge data. Here we illustrate how a geologic/geomorphic framework can provide a basis for describing summer base flow and recession behavior at multiple scales for tributaries of the Willamette River in Oregon. We classified the basin into High Cascade and Western Cascade provinces based on the age of the underlying volcanic bedrock. Using long-term U.S. Geological Survey stream gauge records, we show that summer streamflow volumes, recession characteristics, and timing of response to winter recharge are all linearly related to the percent of High Cascade geology in the contributing area. This analysis illustrates how geology exerts a dominant control on flow regimes in this region and suggests that a geological framework provides a useful basis for interpreting and extrapolating hydrologic behavior.},

To separate these influences for the coterminous$\backslash$nUnited States, we use a set of over 1000 United States Geological$\backslash$nSurvey stream gauges primarily from small, minimally disturbed watersheds$\backslash$nto estimate annual streamflow per unit area since 1920 on a uniform$\backslash$ngrid.

abstract = {An urban watershed continuum framework hypothesizes that there are coupled changes in (1) carbon and nitrogen cycling, (2) groundwater-surface water interactions, and (3) ecosystem metabolism along broader hydrologic flowpaths. It expands our understanding of urban streams beyond a reach scale. We evaluated this framework by analyzing longitudinal patterns in: C and N concentrations and mass balances, groundwater-surface interactions, and stream metabolism and carbon quality from headwaters to larger order streams. 52 monitoring sites were sampled seasonally and monthly along the Gwynns Falls watershed, which drains 170 km2 of the Baltimore Long-Term Ecological Research site. Regarding our first hypothesis of coupled C and N cycles, there were significant inverse linear relationships between nitrate and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen longitudinally (P {\textless} 0.05). Regarding our second hypothesis of coupled groundwater-surface water interactions, groundwater seepage and leaky piped infrastructure contributed significant inputs of water and N to stream reaches based on mass balance and chloride/fluoride tracer data. Regarding our third hypothesis of coupled ecosystem metabolism and carbon quality, stream metabolism increased downstream and showed potential to enhance DOC lability (e.g., {\~{}}4 times higher mean monthly primary production in urban streams than forest streams). DOC lability also increased with distance downstream and watershed urbanization based on protein and humic-like fractions, with major implications for ecosystem metabolism, biological oxygen demand, and CO2 production and alkalinity. Overall, our results showed significant in-stream retention and release (0–100 {\%}) of watershed C and N loads over the scale of kilometers, seldom considered when evaluating monitoring, management, and restoration effectiveness. Given dynamic transport and retention across evolving spatial scales, there is a strong need to longitudinally and synoptically expand studies of hydrologic and biogeochemical processes beyond a stream reach scale along the urban watershed continuum.},

abstract = {Mean annual concentration of SO4(-2) in wet-only deposition has decreased between 1988 and 2006 at the paired watershed study at Bear Brook Watershed in Maine, USA (BBWM) due to substantially decreased emissions of SO(2). Emissions of NO(x) have not changed substantially, but deposition has declined slightly at BBWM. Base cations, NH4+, and Cl(-) concentrations were largely unchanged, with small irregular changes of {\textless}1 $\mu$eq L(-1) per year from 1988 to 2006. Precipitation chemistry, hydrology, vegetation, and temperature drive seasonal stream chemistry. Low flow periods were typical in June-October, with relatively greater contributions of deeper flow solutions with higher pH; higher concentrations of acid-neutralizing capacity, Si, and non-marine Na; and low concentrations of inorganic Al. High flow periods during November-May were typically dominated by solutions following shallow flow paths, which were characterized by lower pH and higher Al and DOC concentrations. Biological activity strongly controlled NO3- and K(+). They were depressed during the growing season and elevated in the fall. Since 1987, East Bear Brook (EB), the reference stream, has been slowly responding to reduced but still elevated acid deposition. Calcium and Mg have declined fairly steadily and faster than SO4(-2), with consequent acidification (lower pH and higher inorganic Al). Eighteen years of experimental treatment with (NH(4))(2)SO(4) enhanced acidification of West Bear Brook's (WB) watershed. Despite the manipulation, NH4+ concentration remained below detection limits at WB, while leaching of NO3- increased. The seasonal pattern for NO3- concentrations in WB, however, remained similar to EB. Mean monthly concentrations of SO4(-2) have increased in WB since 1989, initially only during periods of high flow, but gradually also during base flow. Increases in mean monthly concentrations of Ca(2+), Mg(2+), and K(+) due to the manipulation occurred from 1989 until about 1995, during the depletion of base cations in shallow flow paths in WB. Progressive depletion of Ca and Mg at greater soil depth occurred, causing stream concentrations to decline to pre-manipulation values. Mean monthly Si concentrations did not change in EB or WB, suggesting that the manipulation had no effect on mineral weathering rates. DOC concentrations in both streams did not exhibit inter- or intra-annual trends.},

abstract = {Manifold changes in the freshwater cycle of high-latitude lands and oceans have been reported in the past few years. A synthesis of these changes in freshwater sources and in ocean freshwater storage illustrates the complementary and synoptic temporal pattern and magnitude of these changes over the past 50 years. Increasing river discharge anomalies and excess net precipitation on the ocean contributed approximately 20,000 cubic kilometers of fresh water to the Arctic and high-latitude North Atlantic oceans from lows in the 1960s to highs in the 1990s. Sea ice attrition provided another approximately 15,000 cubic kilometers, and glacial melt added approximately 2000 cubic kilometers. The sum of anomalous inputs from these freshwater sources matched the amount and rate at which fresh water accumulated in the North Atlantic during much of the period from 1965 through 1995. The changes in freshwater inputs and ocean storage occurred in conjunction with the amplifying North Atlantic Oscillation and rising air temperatures. Fresh water may now be accumulating in the Arctic Ocean and will likely be exported southward if and when the North Atlantic Oscillation enters into a new high phase.},

abstract = {Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in 22 UK upland waters have increased by an average of 91{\%} during the last 15 years. Increases have also occurred elsewhere in the UK, northern Europe and North America. A range of potential drivers of these trends are considered, including temperature, rainfall, acid deposition, land-use, nitrogen and CO2 enrichment. From examination of recent environmental changes, spatial patterns in observed trends, and analysis of time series, it is suggested that DOC may be increasing in response to a combination of declining acid deposition and rising temperatures; however it is difficult to isolate mechanisms based on monitoring data alone. Long-term DOC increases may have wide-ranging impacts on freshwater biota, drinking water quality, coastal marine ecosystems and upland carbon balances. Full understanding of the significance of these increases requires further knowledge of the extent of natural long-term variability, and of the natural "reference" state of these systems. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Evaluating long-term changes in river conditions (water quality and discharge) is an important use of hydrologic data. To carry out such evaluations, the hydrologist needs tools to facilitate several key steps in the process: acquiring the data records from a variety of sources, structuring it in ways that facilitate the analysis, processing the data with routines that extract information about changes that may be happening, and displaying findings with graphical techniques. A pair of tightly linked R packages, called dataRetrieval and EGRET (Exploration and Graphics for RivEr Trends), have been developed for carrying out each of these steps in an integrated manner. They are designed to easily accept data from three sources: U.S. Geological Survey hydrologic data, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) STORET data, and user-supplied flat files. The dataRetrieval package not only serves as a “front end” to the EGRET package, it can also be used to easily download many types of hydrologic data and organize it in ways that facilitate many other hydrologic applications. The EGRET package has components oriented towards the description of long-term changes in streamflow statistics (high flow, average flow, and low flow) as well as changes in water quality. For the water-quality analysis, it uses Weighted Regressions on Time, Discharge and Season (WRTDS) to describe long-term trends in both concentration and flux. EGRET also creates a wide range of graphical presentations of the water-quality data and of the WRTDS results. This report serves as a user guide to these two R packages, providing detailed guidance on installation and use of the software, documentation of the analysis methods used, as well as guidance on some of the kinds of questions and approaches that the software can facilitate.},

abstract = {Abstract: This paper discusses the pre-launch spectral characterization of the Operational Land Imager (OLI) at the component, assembly and instrument levels and relates results of those measurements to artifacts observed in the on-orbit imagery. It concludes that the types of artifacts observed and their magnitudes are consistent with the results of the  pre-launch characterizations. The OLI in-band response was characterized both at the integrated instrument level for a sampling of detectors and by an analytical stack-up of component measurements. The out-of-band response was characterized using a combination of Focal Plane Module (FPM) level measurements and optical component level measurements due to better sensitivity. One of the challenges of a pushbroom design is to match the spectral responses for all detectors so that images can be flat-fielded regardless of the spectral nature of the targets in the imagery. Spectral variability can induce striping (detector-to-detector variation), banding (FPM-to-FPM variation) and other artifacts in the final data products. Analyses of the measured spectral response showed that the maximum discontinuity between FPMs due to spectral filter differences is 0.35{\%} for selected targets for all bands except for Cirrus, where there is almost no signal. The average discontinuity between FPMs is 0.12{\%} for the same targets. These results were expected and are in accordance with the OLI requirements. Pre-launch testing identified low levels (within requirements) of spectral crosstalk amongst the three HgCdTe (Cirrus, SWIR1 and SWIR2) bands of the OLI and on-orbit data confirms this crosstalk in the imagery. Further post-launch analyses and simulations revealed that the strongest crosstalk effect is from the SWIR1 band to the Cirrus band; about 0.2{\%} of SWIR1 signal leaks into the Cirrus. Though the total crosstalk signal is only a few counts, it is evident in some scenes when the in-band cirrus signal is very weak. In moist cirrus-free atmospheres and over typical land surfaces, at least 30{\%} of the cirrus signal was due to the SWIR1 band. In the SWIR1 and SWIR2 bands, crosstalk accounts for no more than 0.15{\%} of the total signal.},

abstract = {Photochemical degradation of Congo River dissolved organic matter (DOM) was investigated to examine the fate of terrigenous DOM derived from tropical ecosystems. Tropical riverine DOM receives greater exposure to solar radiation, particularly in large river plumes discharging directly into the open ocean. Initial Congo River DOM exhibited dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration and compositional characteristics typical of organic rich blackwater systems. During a 57 day irradiation experiment, Congo River DOM was shown to be highly photoreactive with a decrease in DOC, chromophoric DOM (CDOM), lignin phenol concentrations ({\OE}{\pounds}8) and carbon-normalized yields ({\OE}{\~{o}}8), equivalent to losses of ‚{\`{a}}{\textordmasculine}45, 85‚{\"{A}}{\`{i}}95, {\textgreater}95 and {\textgreater}95{\%} of initial values, respectively, and a +3.1 ‚{\"{A}}∞ enrichment of the {\OE}¥ 13C-DOC signature. The loss of {\OE}{\~{o}}8 and enrichment of {\OE}¥ 13C-DOC during irradiation was strongly correlated (r = 0.99, p {\textless} 0.01) indicating tight coupling between these biomarkers. Furthermore, the loss of CDOM absorbance was correlated to the loss of {\OE}{\~{o}}8 (e.g., a 355 versus {\OE}{\~{o}}8; r = 0.98, p {\textless} 0.01) and {\OE}¥ 13C-DOC (e.g., a 355 versus {\OE}¥ 13C; r = 0.97, p {\textless} 0.01), highlighting the potential of CDOM absorbance measurements for delineating the photochemical degradation of lignin and thus terrigenous DOM. It is apparent that these commonly used measurements for examination of terrigenous DOM in the oceans have a higher rate of photochemical decay than the bulk DOC pool. Further process-based studies are required to determine the selective removal rates of these biomarkers for advancement of our understanding of the fate of this material in the ocean.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}We investigated how absorption of sunlight by chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) controls the degradation and export of DOM from Imnavait Creek, a beaded stream in the Alaskan Arctic. We measured concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), as well as concentrations and characteristics of CDOM and fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM), during ice-free periods of 2011–2012 in the pools of Imnavait Creek and in soil waters draining to the creek. Spatial and temporal patterns in CDOM and FDOM in Imnavait Creek were analyzed in conjunction with measures of DOM degradation by sunlight and bacteria and assessments of hydrologic residence times and in situ UV exposure. CDOM was the dominant light attenuating constituent in the UV and visible portion of the solar spectrum, with high attenuation coefficients ranging from 86 ± 12 m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} at 305 nm to 3 ± 1 m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} in the photosynthetically active region (PAR). High rates of light absorption and thus light attenuation by CDOM contributed to thermal stratification in the majority of pools in Imnavait Creek under low-flow conditions. In turn, thermal stratification increased the residence time of water and DOM, and resulted in a separation of water masses distinguished by contrasting UV exposure (i.e., UV attenuation by CDOM with depth resulted in bottom waters receiving less UV than surface waters). When the pools in Imnavait Creek were stratified, DOM in the pool bottom water closely resembled soil water DOM in character, while the concentration and character of DOM in surface water was reproduced by experimental photo-degradation of bottom water. These results, in combination with water column rates of DOM degradation by sunlight and bacteria, suggest that photo-degradation is the dominant process controlling DOM fate and export in Imnavait Creek. A conceptual model is presented showing how CDOM amount and lability interact with incident UV light and water residence time to determine whether photo-degradation is "light-limited" or "substrate-limited". We suggest that degradation, and thus export, of DOM in CDOM-rich streams or ponds similar to Imnavait is typically light-limited under most flow conditions.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Land cover transformations have accompanied the rise and fall of civilizations for thousands of years, exerting strong influence on the surrounding environment. Soil erosion and the associated outwash of nutrients are a main cause of eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems. Despite the great challenges of water protection in the face of climate change, large uncertainties remain concerning the timescales for recovery of aquatic ecosystems impacted by hypoxia. This study seeks to address this issue by investigating the sedimentary record of Lake Murten (Switzerland), which witnessed several phases of intensive human land-use over the past 2000 years. Application of geophysical and geochemical methods to a 10 m-long sediment core revealed that soil erosion increased drastically with the rise of the Roman City of Aventicum (30 CE). During this period, the radiocarbon age of the bulk sedimentary organic carbon (OC) increasingly deviated from the modeled deposition age, indicating rapid flushing of old soil OC from the surrounding catchment driven by intensive land-use. Enhanced nutrient delivery resulted in an episode of cultural eutrophication, as shown by the deposition of varved sediments. Human activity drastically decreased towards the end of the Roman period (3rd century CE), resulting in land abandonment and renaturation. Recovery of the lake ecosystem from bottom-water hypoxia after the peak in human activity took around 50 years, while approximately 300 years passed until sediment accumulation reached steady state conditions on the surrounding landscape. These findings suggest that the legacy of anthropogenic perturbation to watersheds may persist for centuries.},

abstract = {Stream-quality monitoring networks in the United States were initiated and expanded after passage of successive federal water-pollution control laws from 1948 to 1972. The first networks addressed information gaps on the extent and severity of stream pollution and served as early warning systems for spills. From 1965 to 1972, monitoring networks expanded to evaluate compliance with stream standards, track emerging issues, and assess water-quality status and trends. After 1972, concerns arose regarding the ability of monitoring networks to determine if water quality was getting better or worse and why. As a result, monitoring networks adopted a hydrologic systems approach targeted to key water-quality issues, accounted for human and natural factors affecting water quality, innovated new statistical methods, and introduced geographic information systems and models that predict water quality at unmeasured locations. Despite improvements, national-scale monitoring networks have declined over time. Only about 1{\%}, or 217, of more than 36,000 US Geological Survey monitoring sites sampled from 1975 to 2014 have been operated throughout the four decades since passage of the 1972 Clean Water Act. Efforts to sustain monitoring networks are important because these networks have collected information crucial to the description of water-quality trends over time and are providing information against which to evaluate future trends.},

abstract = {The surface reflectance, i.e., satellite derived top of atmosphere (TOA) reflectance corrected for the temporally, spatially and spectrally varying scattering and absorbing effects of atmospheric gases and aerosols, is needed to monitor the land surface reliably. For this reason, the surface reflectance, and not TOA reflectance, is used to generate the greater majority of global land products, for example, from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) sensors. Even if atmospheric effects are minimized by sensor design, atmospheric effects are still challenging to correct. In particular, the strong impact of aerosols in the visible and near infrared spectral range can be difficult to correct, because they can be highly discrete in space and time (e.g., smoke plumes) and because of the complex scattering and absorbing properties of aerosols that vary spectrally and with aerosol size, shape, chemistry and density. This paper presents the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) atmospheric correction algorithm that has been developed using the Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum Vectorial (6SV) model, refined to take advantage of the narrow OLI spectral bands (compared to Thematic Mapper/Enhanced Thematic Mapper (TM/ETM+)), improved radiometric resolution and signal-to-noise. In addition, the algorithm uses the new OLI Coastal aerosol band (0.433–0.450$\mu$m), which is particularly helpful for retrieving aerosol properties, as it covers shorter wavelengths than the conventional Landsat, TM and ETM+ blue bands. A cloud and cloud shadow mask has also been developed using the “cirrus” band (1.360–1.390$\mu$m) available on OLI, and the thermal infrared bands from the Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) instrument. The performance of the surface reflectance product from OLI is analyzed over the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) sites using accurate atmospheric correction (based on in situ measurements of the atmospheric properties), by comparison with the MODIS Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) adjusted surface reflectance product and by comparison of OLI derived broadband albedo from United States Surface Radiation Budget Network (US SURFRAD) measurements. The results presented clearly show an improvement of Landsat 8 surface reflectance product over the ad-hoc Landsat 5/7 LEDAPS product.},

abstract = {A period of prolonged warmer, drier-than-normal weather in northwestern Ontario during the 1970s and 1980s resulted in severe forest fires that caused dramatic changes to lake and stream catchments. The changed interactions of weather with catchments and hydrological processes caused unexpected changes in physical, chemical, and biological processes in lakes and streams. Permanent first-order streams became ephemeral. Flows at spring melt were lower, and chemical exports from catchments were reduced. Although catchments burned by forest fire had slightly higher flows and chemical exports than unburned basins in the years following fires, chemical exports generally declined due to lower streamflow. Decreased exports of silica indicated lower rates of weathering. Base cation exports also decreased, as did the ratio of base cations to strong acid anions in streams. Changes in lakes included warmer temperatures, clearer waters, deeper thermoclines and euphotic zones, higher alkalinities, and higher concentrations of base cations and nitrogen, but lower concentrations of dissolved organic C, silica, and P. The increase in alkalinity was caused by increases in the ratio of base cations to strong acid anions, resulting from the interaction of increased water retention, microbial sulfate reduction, and exchanges of cations between water and sediments. Declines in chlorophyll and increases in phytoplankton biomass were observed, but there was no detectable effect on areal phytoplankton production. Summer subthermocline habitats for cold stenotherms were reduced slightly in extent as the results of thermocline deepening and lower hypolimnetic oxygen. There is considerable potential for interaction between climatic change and other human perturbations affecting boreal lakes, including acidification, increased incident UV radiation, eutrophication, and overharvesting.},

abstract = {Monitoring and understanding the physical, chemical and biological status of global inland waters are immensely important to scientists and policy makers alike. Whereas conventional monitoring approaches tend to be limited in terms of spatial coverage and temporal frequency, remote sensing has the potential to provide an invaluable complementary source of data at local to global scales. Furthermore, as sensors, methodologies, data availability and the network of researchers and engaged stakeholders in this field develop, increasingly widespread use of remote sensing for operational monitoring of inland waters can be envisaged. This special issue on Remote Sensing of Inland Waters comprises 16 articles on freshwater ecosystems around the world ranging from lakes and reservoirs to river systems using optical data from a range of in situ instruments as well as airborne and satellite platforms. The papers variably focus on the retrieval of in-water optical and biogeochemical parameters as well as information on the biophysical properties of shoreline and benthic vegetation. Methodological advances include refined approaches to adjacency correction, inversion-based retrieval models and in situ inherent optical property measurements in highly turbid waters. Remote sensing data are used to evaluate models and theories of environmental drivers of change in a number of different aquatic ecosystems. The range of contributions to the special issue highlights not only the sophistication of methods and the diversity of applications currently being developed, but also the growing international community active in this field. In this introductory paper we briefly highlight the progress that the community has made over recent decades as well as the challenges that remain. It is argued that the operational use of remote sensing for inland water monitoring is a realistic ambition if we can continue to build on these recent achievements.},

However, not a single remote sensing characteristic of the twelve considered by us can give well matching isolines if we use the regression formulae determined on the basis of the whole data set (four expeditions together).

abstract = {In temperate latitudes, toxic cyanobacteria blooms often occur in eutrophied ecosystems during warm months. Many common bloom-forming cyanobacteria have toxic and non-toxic strains which co-occur and are visually indistinguishable but can be quantified molecularly. Toxic Microcystis cells possess a suite of microcystin synthesis genes (mcyA–mcyJ), while non-toxic strains do not. For this study, we assessed the temporal dynamics of toxic and non-toxic strains of Microcystis by quantifying the microcystin synthetase gene (mcyD) and the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene, 16S (an indicator of total Microcystis), from samples collected from four lakes across the Northeast US over a two-year period. Nutrient concentrations and water quality were measured and experiments were conducted which examined the effects of elevated levels of temperatures (+4°C), nitrogen, and phosphorus on the growth rates of toxic and non-toxic strains of Microcystis. During the study, toxic Microcystis cells comprised between 12{\%} and 100{\%} of the total Microcystis population in Lake Ronkonkoma, NY, and between 0.01{\%} and 6{\%} in three other systems. In all lakes, molecular quantification of toxic (mcyD-possessing) Microcystis was a better predictor of in situ microcystin levels than total cyanobacteria, total Microcystis, chlorophyll a, or other factors, being significantly correlated with the toxin in every lake studied. Experimentally enhanced temperatures yielded significantly increased growth rates of toxic Microcystis in 83{\%} of experiments conducted, but did so for non-toxic Microcystis in only 33{\%} of experiments, suggesting that elevated temperatures yield more toxic Microcystis cells and/or cells with more mcyD copies per cell, with either scenario potentially yielding more toxic blooms. Furthermore, concurrent increases in temperature and P concentrations yielded the highest growth rates of toxic Microcystis cells in most experiments suggesting that future eutrophication and climatic warming may additively promote the growth of toxic, rather than non-toxic, populations of Microcystis, leading to blooms with higher microcystin content.},

abstract = {Although there are considerable site-based data for individual or groups of ecosystems, these datasets are widely scattered, have different data formats and conventions, and often have limited accessibility. At the broader scale, national datasets exist for a large number of geospatial features of land, water, and air that are needed to fully understand variation among these ecosystems. However, such datasets originate from different sources and have different spatial and temporal resolutions. By taking an open-science perspective and by combining site-based ecosystem datasets and national geospatial datasets, science gains the ability to ask important research questions related to grand environmental challenges that operate at broad scales. Documentation of such complicated database integration efforts, through peer-reviewed papers, is recommended to foster reproducibility and future use of the integrated database. Here, we describe the major steps, challenges, and considerations in building an integrated database of lake ecosystems, called LAGOS (LAke multi-scaled GeOSpatial and temporal database), that was developed at the sub-continental study extent of 17 US states (1,800,000 km2). LAGOS includes two modules: LAGOSGEO, with geospatial data on every lake with surface area larger than 4 ha in the study extent ({\~{}}50,000 lakes), including climate, atmospheric deposition, land use/cover, hydrology, geology, and topography measured across a range of spatial and temporal extents; and LAGOSLIMNO, with lake water quality data compiled from {\~{}}100 individual datasets for a subset of lakes in the study extent ({\~{}}10,000 lakes). Procedures for the integration of datasets included: creating a flexible database design; authoring and integrating metadata; documenting data provenance; quantifying spatial measures of geographic data; quality-controlling integrated and derived data; and extensively documenting the database. Our procedures make a large, complex, and integrated database reproducible and extensible, allowing users to ask new research questions with the existing database or through the addition of new data. The largest challenge of this task was the heterogeneity of the data, formats, and metadata. Many steps of data integration need manual input from experts in diverse fields, requiring close collaboration.},

The only significant regional trend was an increase in flow-adjusted concentrations of total phosphorus in the central United States, which corresponded to increases in phosphorus inputs from fertilizer in the region, particularly west of the Mississippi River. A similar upward regional trend in observed total phosphorus concentrations in the central United States was not found, likely because precipitation and runoff decreased during drought conditions in the region, offsetting the increased source loading on the land surface. A greater number of regional trends would have been significant if spatial correlation had been disregarded, indicating the importance of spatial correlation modifications in regional trend assessments when sites are not spatially independent.},

abstract = {Colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) has been widely studied as part of efforts to improve understanding of the aquatic carbon cycle, by laboratory, in situ, and remote sensing methods. We studied ecoregion-scale differences in CDOM and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to understand variability in organic matter composition and the use of CDOM as a proxy for DOC. Data from 299 lakes across the U.S. Upper Midwest showed that CDOM, measured as absorptivity at 440 nm (a440), correlated strongly with DOC (R2 = 0.81, n = 412). Colored lakes in the Northern Lakes and Forests (NLF) ecoregion drove this relationship. Lakes in the North Central Hardwood Forests (NCHF) had low color (most had a440 {\textless} 3 m−1) and weaker CDOM-DOC relationships (R2 = 0.47). Spectral slopes and specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA), indicated relatively low aromaticity and non-terrestrial DOM sources in low color lakes. Multiple regression analyses that included total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) and CDOM, but not chlorophyll a, improved DOC estimates in low color lakes, suggesting a dominant contribution of non-planktonic sources of low color DOM in these lakes. Our results show that CDOM is a reliable, regional proxy for DOC in lakes where forests and wetlands dominate the landscape and the DOM is primarily terrestrial in origin. Mapping of lake DOC at broad spatial scales by satellite-derived CDOM has lower accuracy in low color lakes.},

abstract = {The influence of salinity and water chemistry on Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca, and Ba/Ca ratios in the aragonitic shells of the Manila clam was investigated. Clams were reared at constant temperature (20°C) under different controlled conditions of salinity, commonly encountered in their natural habitat. Clams were held in three tanks with a constant salinity of 35 for the first 35days, and then two tanks were changed to lower salinities (20 and 28) for the next 29days. Individual shell Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca, and Ba/Ca ratios were studied through time. Despite stable conditions (temperature, salinity, and Mg/Cawater) for clams reared at salinity 35 during the experiment, Mg/Ca shell ratios increased through the time. Moreover the salinity decrease at t35slowed the increase of Mg/Ca shell ratios at salinity 28 and resulted in an Mg/Cashelldecrease at salinity 20, despite similar Mg/Cawaterratios in the different salinity treatments. Microprobe analyses illustrate that Mg varies along contemporaneous growth lines. The variable shell Mg/Ca ratios suggest that incorporation of magnesium into shell carbonate is strongly regulated by the organism and not by environmental conditions. Interestingly, microprobe analyses illustrated that Mg was not associated with shell sulfur as other studies have suggested. Sr/Ca shell ratios of clams reared at salinity 35 and under constant conditions were also not as constant as expected if Sr/Ca ratios were an environmental proxy. There was an inverse correlation between shell Sr/Ca and salinity despite a slight positive correlation between salinity and Sr/Ca ratios of the water, indicating that Sr/Ca ratios do not reflect environmental conditions. A strong inverse correlation between salinity and Ba/Ca shell ratios (and a positive correlation between Ba/Ca shell and Ba/Ca water) was observed. Therefore, Ba/Ca shell ratios seem to be a promising proxy of high-resolution (1day) salinity variations in estuarine waters (via the relationship between Ba/Ca water and salinity). This study clearly illustrates that both Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios in aragonite shells are not under environmental control and that Ba/Ca ratios are, with the later tracking high-resolution water Ba/Ca ratios and hence estuarine salinity variations.},

Located in the course of River Cybina, Malta{\'{n}}ski Reservoir (Western Poland) is an artificial shallow water body built for recreation and sport purposes which undergoes restoration treatment (drainage) every 4 years. In the present study, we demonstrate an accumulation of nine metals (Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn) in water, sediment, three bivalve species (Anodonta anatina, Anodonta cygnea, Unio tumidus), and macrophyte Phragmites australis collected before complete drainage in November 2012. The mean concentrations of metals in the sediment, bivalves, and P. australis (roots and leaves) decreased in the following order: Fe {\textgreater} Mn {\textgreater} Zn {\textgreater} Cu {\textgreater} Cr {\textgreater} Ni {\textgreater} Pb {\textgreater} Co {\textgreater} Cd. A considerably higher bioconcentration of metals was observed in samples collected from the western and southern sites which undergo a higher degree of human impact. Sediments were found to be a better indicator of metal contamination than water samples. Interspecific differences in levels of metal accumulation were found between investigated unionids. U. tumidus accumulated higher levels of Cr, positively correlated with ambient concentrations, predisposing this species as a potential bioindicator of this metal in aquatic environments. On the other hand, species of Anodonta genus demonstrated higher accumulation of Cu and Cd. Positive correlations were found between Pb content in the sediments and tissues of all three bivalve species. In P. australis, metals were largely retained in roots except for Cd and Pb for which higher concentrations were found in leaves suggesting additional absorption of these metals from aerial sources. P. australis and bivalve from the Malta{\'{n}}ski Reservoir may be a potential source of toxic metals for animals feeding upon them and contribute to further contamination in the food chain.},

abstract = {In this study we test if calcite shells of the common mussel, Mytilus edulis, contain barium in proportion to the water in which they grew. Similar to all bivalves analyzed to date, the [Ba/Ca]shellprofiles are characterized by a relatively flat background [Ba/Ca]shell, interrupted by sharp [Ba/Ca]shellpeaks. Previous studies have focused on these [Ba/Ca]shellpeaks, but not on the background [Ba/Ca]shell. We show that in both laboratory and field experiments, there is a direct relationship between the background [Ba/Ca]shelland [Ba/Ca]waterin M. edulis shells. The laboratory and field data provided background Ba/Ca partition coefficients (DBa) of 0.10 ± 0.02 and 0.071 ± 0.001, respectively. This range is slightly higher than the DBapreviously determined for inorganic calcite, and slightly lower than foraminiferal calcite. These data suggest that M. edulis shells can be used as an indicator of [Ba/ Ca]water, and therefore, fossil or archaeological M. edulis shells could be used to extend knowledge of estuarine dissolved Ba throughputs back in time. Moreover, considering the inverse relationship between [Ba/Ca]waterand salinity, background [Ba/Ca]shelldata could be used as an estuary specific indicator of salinity. The cause of the [Ba/Ca]shellpeaks is more confusing, both the laboratory and field experiments indicate that they cannot be used as a direct proxy of [Ba/Ca]wateror phytoplankton production, but may possibly be caused by barite ingestion. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Freshwater bivalve shells have the ability to record past environmental information, and may act as archives of road-salt pollution. We sampled Elliptio complanata shells from four streams, as well as specimens collected in 1877. Average [Na/Ca]shell was highest in modern shells from the stream with the highest sodium concentrations, and low in shells collected from this same stream in 1877 as well as in the shells from other streams, suggesting that [Na/Ca]shell serves as a proxy for road-salt pollution. We expected higher [Na/Ca]shell in winter and spring. However, high-resolution [Na/Ca]shell analyses along the growth axis of one shell did not reveal any clear subannual patterns, which could be the result of shell growth cessation in winter and/or during periods of high stream sodium concentrations. Therefore, bulk [Na/Ca]shell analysis from multiple shells can be used as a proxy of large changes in stream sodium concentrations, but high-resolution variations in stream sodium concentrations do not seem to be recorded in the shells.},

abstract = {To further evaluate the potential use of Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios as a paleothermometer in the shell carbonate of the blue mussel Mytilus edulis, we grew juvenile mussels (∼15 mm shell height; {\textless}2 years old) collected from Maine, USA, in controlled environments for 4 months. The four-by-three factorial design consisted of four circulating temperature baths (7, 11, 15 and 19°C), and three salinity ranges (23, 28, and 32). During the experiment, water Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca molar ratios were monitored weekly, and showed little variation across all salinity and temperature ranges. Data from sampled shells including all salinity treatments yielded relatively poor relationships between shell elemental chemistry and water temperatures. However, if only the low salinity treatment data (23) are used, the relationships between shell elemental chemistry and water temperature improve moderately. Based on the data presented here, it may be possible to use Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios from the shell carbonate of juvenile M. edulis to reconstruct paleotemperatures in estuarine settings (salinity below 24) with a corresponding RMSE (root mean squared error; 95{\%} confidence interval) of ±2.4°C and ±2.8°C, respectively. In order for this methodology to be statistically meaningful, water temperature changes must be rather large, as the errors associated with using Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios from the shell material of M. edulis are substantial. Further work is required to determine if the findings presented here can be duplicated, and if the potential salinity effect is pervasive.},

abstract = {Natural lagoons and estuaries worldwide are experiencing accelerated ecosystem degradation due to increased anthropogenic pressure. As a key driver of coastal zone dynamics, suspended sediment concentration (SSC) is difficult to monitor with adequate spatial and temporal resolutions both in the field and using remote sensing. In particular, the spatial resolutions of currently available remote sensing data generated by satellite sensors designed for ocean color retrieval, such as MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) or SeaWiFS (Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor), are too coarse to capture the dimension and geomorphological heterogeneity of most estuaries and lagoons. In the present study, we explore the use of hyperspectral (Hyperion) and multispectral data, i.e., the Landsat TM (Thematic Mapper) and ETM+ (Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus), ASTER (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer), and ALOS (Advanced Land Observing Satellite), to estimate SSC through semi-analytical and empirical approaches in the Venice lagoon (Italy). Key parameters of the retrieval models are calibrated and cross-validated by matching the remote sensing estimates of SSC with in situ data from a network of water quality sensors. Our analysis shows that, despite the higher spectral resolution, hyperspectral data provide limited advantages over the use of multispectral data, mainly due to information redundancy and cross-band correlation. Meanwhile, the limited historical archive of hyperspectral data (usually acquired on demand) severely reduces the chance of observing high turbidity events, which are relatively rare but critical in controlling the coastal sediment and geomorphological dynamics. On the contrary, retrievals using available multispectral data can encompass a much wider range of SSC values due to their frequent acquisitions and longer historical archive. For the retrieval methods considered in this study, we find that the semi-analytical method outperforms empirical approaches, when applied to both the hyperspectral and multispectral dataset. Interestingly, the improved performance emerges more clearly when the data used for testing are kept separated from those used in the calibration, suggesting a greater ability of semi-analytical models to “generalize” beyond the specific data set used for model calibration.},

abstract = {This paper describes the use of ocean color remote sensing data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard the Aqua satellite to characterize turbidity in Lake Okeechobee and its primary drainage basins, the Caloosahatchee and St. Lucie estuaries from 2002 to 2010. Drainage modification and agricultural development in southern Florida transport sediments and nutrients from watershed agricultural areas to Lake Okeechobee. As a result of development around Lake Okeechobee and the estuaries that are connected to Lake Okeechobee, estuarine conditions have also been adversely impacted, resulting in salinity and nutrient fluctuations. The measurement of water turbidity in lacustrine and estuarine ecosystems allows researchers to understand important factors such as light limitation and the potential release of nutrients from re-suspended sediments. Based on a strong correlation between water turbidity and normalized water-leaving radiance at the near-infrared (NIR) band (nLw(869)), a new satellite water turbidity algorithm has been developed for Lake Okeechobee. This study has shown important applications with satellite-measured nLw(869) data for water quality monitoring and measurements for turbid inland lakes. MODIS-Aqua-measured water property data are derived using the shortwave infrared (SWIR)-based atmospheric correction algorithm in order to remotely obtain synoptic turbidity data in Lake Okeechobee and normalized water-leaving radiance using the red band (nLw(645)) in the Caloosahatchee and St. Lucie estuaries. We found varied, but distinct seasonal, spatial, and event driven turbidity trends in Lake Okeechobee and the Caloosahatchee and St. Lucie estuary regions. Wind waves and hurricanes have the largest influence on turbidity trends in Lake Okeechobee, while tides, currents, wind waves, and hurricanes influence the Caloosahatchee and St. Lucie estuarine areas. {\textcopyright} 2012.},

This study applied high-frequency depth profiles in three stratified lakes of different trophic status to investigate (1) the importance of vertical variations in metabolic rates, (2) the effects of changes in the depth of the mixed layer (Zmix) and the photic zone (Zeu), and (3) the photoacclimative responses of the aquatic autotrophs to changes in these conditions. Taking account of vertical differences in metabolism improved the reliability of whole-areal NEP estimates during stratification. Whereas the hypolimnion was always heterotrophic, and the epilimnion was mostly autotrophic, the metalimnion had NEP . 0 when Zeu . Zmix. Although most of GPP and R occurred in the epilimnion, between 0{\%} and 20{\%} of GPP and 4{\%} and 37{\%} of R took place in the metalimnion. Areal metabolic estimates based on surface measurements deviated up to 60{\%} for GPP and 80{\%}for R when Zeu . Zmix. The vertical variability in metabolism was driven by available light in both the epi- and metalimnion. Coupling between GPP and R was low in all layers and indicated increasing background R with depth. Light utilization efficiency was significantly higher under low light conditions, indicating photophysiological acclimation of phytoplankton to decreasing light in the metalimnion. Measurements},

abstract = {to detect water constituents' concentrations and salinity of the Pearl River Estuary (PRE), we analyzed the spectral properties of water constituents and investigated the relationships between field water reflectance spectra and water constituents' concentrations based on the synchronous in-situ hyper-spectral data analysis. Two strong relationships were discovered (two linear fit described respectively the positive correlation), one between in-situ reflectance ratio R680/R527 and total suspended sediment concentrations (TSS) (R2=65{\%}) and the other between chlorophyll-a concentrations and the reflectance ratio R704/R513 (R2=78{\%}); however, the result also showed that the absorption coefficient of color dissolved organic matter (CDOM) was not tightly correlated with reflectance. In addition, we also observed the significant relationships (R2=79{\%}) between TSS and surface salinity. Finally, we were able to develop a novel method to detect water constituents' concentrations and surface salinity of river estuary waters from the calibrated EO-1 Hyperion reflectance data in the PRE. The EO-1 Hyperion derived surface salinity and water constituents' concentrations were validated using in-situ data that were collected on December 21, 2006, and synchronous with EO-1 Hyperion satellite imagery acquisition. The results showed that the semi-empirical relationships are capable of predicting salinity and water constituents' concentrations from EO-1 Hyperion imagery.},

This is considered to be especially useful in coastal waters, where the determination of chlorophyll from water-leaving radiance spectra using the conventional blue/green ratio method is often complicated by high concentrations of gelbstoff and suspended matter. Based on a variety of studies, three spectral channels centred at 665, 681.25 and 705 nm were included in the design of MERIS for retrieving the fluorescence signal. This paper presents observations with high-resolution spectrometers which demonstrate the main factors affecting the observed signal in the red part of the spectrum. These factors are absorption by pure water, scattering by suspended particles, absorption and fluorescence of chlorophyll and the influence of submerged macrophyta. The influence of exceptional blooms such as 'red tides' on radiance spectra is also discussed. The paper shows how the combination of these effects can be understood using simple and easy-to-use radiative transfer models, and can be exploited by MERIS for improved mapping of phytoplankton, red tides and coastal, submerged and tidal flat vegetation.},

abstract = {The accurate measurement of suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentrations in coastal waters is of crucial importance for ecosystem studies, sediment transport monitoring, and assessment of anthropogenic impacts in the coastal ocean. Ocean color remote sensing is an efficient tool to monitor SPM spatio-temporal variability in coastal waters. However, near-shore satellite images are complex to correct for atmospheric effects due to the proximity of land and to the high level of reflectance caused by high SPM concentrations in the visible and near-infrared spectral regions. The water reflectance signal ($\rho$w) tends to saturate at short visible wavelengths when the SPM concentration increases. Using a comprehensive dataset of high-resolution satellite imagery and in situ SPM and water reflectance data, this study presents (i) an assessment of existing atmospheric correction (AC) algorithms developed for turbid coastal waters; and (ii) a switching method that automatically selects the most sensitive SPM vs. $\rho$w relationship, to avoid saturation effects when computing the SPM concentration. The approach is applied to satellite data acquired by three medium-high spatial resolution sensors (Landsat-8/Operational Land Imager, National Polar-Orbiting Partnership/Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite and Aqua/Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer) to map the SPM concentration in some of the most turbid areas of the European coastal ocean, namely the Gironde and Loire estuaries as well as Bourgneuf Bay on the French Atlantic coast. For all three sensors, AC methods based on the use of short-wave infrared (SWIR) spectral bands were tested, and the consistency of the retrieved water reflectance was examined along transects from low- to high-turbidity waters. For OLI data, we also compared a SWIR-based AC (ACOLITE) with a method based on multi-temporal analyses of atmospheric constituents (MACCS). For the selected scenes, the ACOLITE-MACCS difference was lower than 7{\%}. Despite some inaccuracies in $\rho$w retrieval, we demonstrate that the SPM concentration can be reliably estimated using OLI, MODIS and VIIRS, regardless of their differences in spatial and spectral resolutions. Match-ups between the OLI-derived SPM concentration and autonomous field measurements from the Loire and Gironde estuaries' monitoring networks provided satisfactory results.

abstract = {Accurate quantification of CO2 flux across the air-water interface and identification of the mechanisms driving CO2 concentrations in lakes and reservoirs is critical to integrating aquatic systems into large-scale carbon budgets, and to predicting the response of these systems to changes in climate or terrestrial carbon cycling. Large-scale estimates of the role of lakes and reservoirs in the carbon cycle, however, typically must rely on aggregation of spatially and temporally inconsistent data from disparate sources. We performed a spatially comprehensive analysis of CO2 concentration and air-water fluxes in lakes and reservoirs of the contiguous United States using large, consistent data sets, and modeled the relative contribution of inorganic and organic carbon loading to vertical CO2 fluxes. Approximately 70{\%} of lakes and reservoirs are supersaturated with respect to the atmosphere during the summer (June-September). Although there is considerable interregional and intraregional variability, lakes and reservoirs represent a net source of CO2 to the atmosphere of approximately 40 Gg C d(-1) during the summer. While in-lake CO2 concentrations correlate with indicators of in-lake net ecosystem productivity, virtually no relationship exists between dissolved organic carbon and pCO(2,aq). Modeling suggests that hydrologic dissolved inorganic carbon supports pCO(2,aq) in most supersaturated systems (to the extent that 12{\%} of supersaturated systems simultaneously exhibit positive net ecosystem productivity), and also supports primary production in most CO2-undersaturated systems. Dissolved inorganic carbon loading appears to be an important determinant of CO2 concentrations and fluxes across the air-water interface in the majority of lakes and reservoirs in the contiguous United States.},

Information on the abundance and distribution of cyanobacteria is fundamental to support risk assessment and management activities.

The approach was developed and tested using fourteen years (2000–2014) of MODIS images, which showed significant spatial and temporal variability of the PC:Chla ratio, an indicator of cyanobacterial dominance. The results had unbiased RMS uncertainties of {\textless}60{\%} for Chla ranging between 10 and 300 $\mu$g/L, and unbiased RMS uncertainties of {\textless}65{\%} for PC between 10 and 500 $\mu$g/L. Further analysis showed the importance of nutrient and climate conditions for this dominance. Low TN:TP ratios ({\textless}29:1) and elevated temperatures were found to influence the seasonal shift of phytoplankton community. The resultant MODIS Chla and PC products were then used for cyanobacterial risk mapping with a decision tree classification model. The resulting Water Quality Decision Matrix (WQDM) was designed to assist authorities in the identification of possible intake areas, as well as specific months when higher frequency monitoring and more intense water treatment would be required if the location of the present intake area remained the same.

Water quality data including total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and dissolved oxygen; local meteorology data; and global climate trends were examined to reveal the factors influencing the formation of the algal blooms. Results for the 2000–2011 study period show that the annual algal bloom typically begins between March and May in Taihu Lake. All large-scale blooms originate from northern Taihu Lake (Meiliang Bay and Zhushan Bay). Some small-scale blooms originate from southwestern Taihu Lake, but the duration of these blooms is very brief because of episodes of turbulent mixing due to high wind speed. Nutrient supply is the main factor influencing algal mass propagation during bloom periods, and temperature changes may trigger algal recovery. The algal bloom area significantly decreased when wind speed is greater than 4 m/s, causing turbulence and changes in algal buoyancy. A strong East Asian summer monsoon transporting warm air to the lake is shown to extend the duration of algal blooms in Taihu Lake, as occurred in 2007.},

abstract = {As a step forward to validating the retrieval algorithm associated with the MERIS (Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer) sensor onboard the European Space Agency's ENVISAT satellite, we compare scaling factors for a(pig)(442) (pigment absorption coefficient at 442 nm) versus chl-a concentration, and for b(p)(440) (scattering coefficient for particles at 440 nm) versus TSM (total suspended matter) concentration, as well as in situ measurements of chl-a and TSM concentrations in Murchison Bay, Lake Victoria, with MERIS level 2 products. Our comparisons show that MERIS chl-a data products underestimate the in situ chl-a concentration by a factor of about 0.6, and that MERIS level 2 products overestimate the in situ TSM concentration and the yellow substance absorption coefficient by a factor of about 2. Application of a local inherent optical property (IOP) scaling factor improves the retrieval provided by MERIS level 2 products. The MERIS level 2 products also underestimate the water-leaving reflectance. These discrepancies between retrievals from MERIS data and in situ measurements are due to the current imperfect atmospheric correction algorithm for inland waters. Therefore, a need arises to develop site-specific bio-optical models and to improve existing MERIS retrieval algorithms.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}In just the past five years, the field of Earth observation has evolved from the relatively staid approaches of government space agencies into a plethora of sensing opportunities afforded by CubeSats, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), and smartphone technologies that have been embraced by both for-profit companies and individual researchers. Over the previous decades, space agency efforts have brought forth well-known and immensely useful satellites such as the Landsat series and the Gravity Research and Climate Experiment (GRACE) system, with costs typically on the order of one billion dollars per satellite and with concept-to-launch timelines on the order of two decades (for new missions). More recently, the proliferation of smartphones has helped to miniaturise sensors and energy requirements, facilitating advances in the use of CubeSats that can be launched by the dozens, while providing 3{\&}ndash;5{\&}thinsp;m resolution sensing of the Earth on a daily basis. Start-up companies that did not exist five years ago now operate more satellites in orbit than any space agency and at costs that are a mere fraction of an agency mission. With these advances come new space-borne measurements, such as high-definition video for understanding real-time cloud formation, storm development, flood propagation, precipitation tracking, or for constructing digital surfaces using structure-from-motion techniques. Closer to the surface, measurements from small unmanned drones and tethered balloons have mapped snow depths, floods, and estimated evaporation at sub-meter resolution, pushing back on spatiotemporal constraints and delivering new process insights. At ground level, precipitation has been measured using signal attenuation between antennae mounted on cell phone towers, while the proliferation of mobile devices has enabled citizenscience to record photos of environmental conditions, estimate daily average temperatures from battery state, and enable the measurement of other hydrologically important variables such as channel depths using commercially available wireless devices. Global internet access is being pursued via high altitude balloons, solar planes, and hundreds of planned satellite launches, providing a means to exploit the Internet of Things as a new measurement domain. Such global access will enable real-time collection of data from billions of smartphones or from remote research platforms. This future will produce petabytes of data that can only be{\ldots}},

abstract = {Phytoplankton biomass is important to monitor in lakes due to its influence on water quality and lake productivity. Phytoplankton has also been identified as sensitive to environmental change, with shifts in the seasonality of blooms, or phenology, resulting from changing temperature and nutrient conditions. A satellite remote sensing approach to retrieving and mapping freshwater phytoplankton phenology is demonstrated here in application to Lake Balaton, Hungary. Chlorophyll- a (chl- a) concentration mapping using Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) allows new insights into such spatiotemporal dynamics for Lake Balaton as bloom start, peak and end timing, duration, maximum chl- a concentrations, spatial extent, rates of increase and decrease, and bloom chl- a concentration integral. TIMESAT software is used to extract and map these phenology metrics. Three approaches to time series smoothing are compared and mapped metrics are evaluated in comparison with phenology metrics of in situ chl- a. The high degree of both spatial and temporal variability is highlighted and discussed, as are methodological limitations and correlation between phenology metrics. Both the feasibility of and novel insights permitted through such phenology mapping are demonstrated, and priority topics for future research are suggested.},

Preliminary data from MERIS show that its imagery of large lakes is superior to that of other common ocean colour sensors. The main objective of the present study is to evaluate the MERIS data on large European lakes, Vanern and Vattern in Sweden and Peipsi in Estonia/Russia. In these lakes, coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) can be a major contributor to the optical properties of the water. Another characteristic of the waters under investigation is the large temporal and spatial variability in the concentrations of chlorophyll (C-Chl) and suspended sediments (C-TSS). Potentially toxic cyanobacterial blooms occur in Lake Peipsi in late summer. We have compared the MERIS products from the latest reprocessing (finished in March 2006) with available in situ data. There is a reasonably good correlation between the MERIS algal{\_}2 product and the measured C-chl over all three lakes, but no correlation was found for other optically active substances.

abstract = {Despite an increased awareness by governments and the general public of the need for protecting all types of aquatic habitats, human impacts continue to impair the services that these ecosystems provide. Increased monitoring activities that focus on all major biological compartments are needed to quantify the present condition of Earth's aquatic resources and to evaluate the effectiveness of regulations designed to rehabilitate damaged ecosystems. Algae are an ecologically important group in most aquatic ecosystems but are often ignored as indicators of aquatic ecosystem change. We attribute this situation both to an underappreciation of the utility of algal indicators among non- phycologists and to a lack of standardized methods for monitoring with algae. Because of their nutritional needs and their position at the base of aquatic foodwebs, algal indicators provide relatively unique information concerning ecosystem condition compared with commonly used animal indicators. Algae respond rapidly and predictably to a wide range of pollutants and, thus, provide potentially useful early warning signals of deteriorating conditions and the possible causes. Algal assemblages provide one of the few benchmarks for establishing historical water quality conditions and for characterizing the minimally impacted biological condition of many disturbed ecosystems. Preliminary comparisons suggest that algal indicators are a cost-effective monitoring tool as well. Based on available evidence from field studies, we recommend development of taxonomic indicators based on diatoms (Bacillariophyceae) as a standardized protocol for monitoring ecosystem change. Both population- and community-level indices have inherent strengths, and limitations and information from both levels of biological organization should be utilized in tandem. However, further information concerning species tolerances to a variety of anthropogenic stressors is needed if autecological indices are to be used routinely for monitoring purposes. While functional measures (e.g. productivity) may also prove useful as monitoring tools, further investigation is required to characterize the reliability of alternative methodologies and to assess the consistency of these indicators under varying field conditions.},

This paper draws from previously published studies on high-resolution, hyperspectral remote sensing of coastal and inland waters and provides an overview of how the HyspIRI mission could enable the retrieval of new aquatic biophysical products or improve the retrieval accuracy of existing satellite-derived products (e.g., inherent optical properties, phytoplankton functional types, pigment composition, chlorophyll-a concentration, etc.). The intent of this paper is to introduce the development of the HyspIRI mission to the coastal and inland remote sensing community and to provide information regarding several potential data products that were not originally part of the HyspIRI mission objectives but could be applicable to research related to coastal and inland waters.

abstract = {Water clarity is a strong indicator of regional water quality. Unlike other common water- quality metrics, such as chlorophyll a, total P, or trophic status, clarity can be accurately and efficiently estimated remotely on a regional scale. Satellite-based remote sensing is useful in regions with many lakes where traditional field-sampling techniques may be prohibitively expensive. Repeated sampling of easily accessed lakes can lead to spatially irregular, nonrandom samples of a region. Remote sensing remedies this problem. We applied a remote monitoring protocol we had previously developed for Maine lakes .8 ha based on Landsat satellite data recorded during 1995–2010 to identify spatial and temporal patterns in Maine lake clarity. We focused on the overlapping region of Landsat paths 11 and 12 to increase availability of cloud-free images in August and early September, a period of relative lake stability and seasonal poor-clarity conditions well suited for annual monitoring. We divided Maine into 3 regions (northeastern, south-central, western) based on morphometric and chemical lake features. We found a general decrease in average statewide lake clarity from 4.94 to 4.38 m during 1995–2010. Water clarity ranged from 4 to 6m during 1995–2010, but it decreased consistently during 2005–2010. Clarity in both the northeastern and western lake regions has decreased from 5.22 m in 1995 to 4.36 and 4.21 m, respectively, in 2010, whereas lake clarity in the south-central lake region (4.50 m) has not changed since 1995. Climate change, timber harvesting, or watershed morphometry may be responsible for regional water-clarity decline. Remote sensing of regional water clarity provides a more complete spatial perspective of lake water quality than existing, interest-based sampling. However, field sampling done under existing monitoring programs can be used to calibrate accurate models designed to estimate water clarity remotely},

abstract = {Landsat has successfully been applied to map Secchi disk depth of inland water bodies. Operational use for monitoring a dynamic variable like Secchi disk depth is however limited by the 16-day overpass cycle of the Landsat system and cloud cover. Low spatial resolution Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) image captured twice a day could potentially overcome these problems. However, its potential for mapping Secchi disk depth of inland water bodies has so far rarely been explored. This study compared two image sources, MODIS and Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM), for mapping the tempo-spatial dynamics of Secchi disk depth in Poyang Lake National Nature Reserve, China. Secchi disk depths recorded at weekly intervals from April to October in 2004 and 2005 were related to 5 Landsat TM and 22 MODIS images respectively. Two multiple regression models including the blue and red bands of Landsat TM and MODIS respectively explained 83{\%} and 88{\%} of the variance of the natural logarithm of Secchi disk depth. The standard errors of the predictions were 0.20 and 0.37m for Landsat TM and MODIS-based models. A high correlation (r=0.94) between the predicted Secchi disk depth derived from the two models was observed. A discussion of advantages and disadvantages of both sensors leads to the conclusion that MODIS offers the possibility to monitor water transparency more regularly and cheaply in relatively big and frequently cloud covered lakes as is with Poyang Lake.},

abstract = {Planktonic cyanobacteria primarily develop in lentic water bodies, such as lakes and water reservoirs. In certain instances, toxin-producing cyanobacterial populations might dominate the phytoplankton community. Satellite remote sensing is a useful tool for large spatial scale monitoring of cyanobacteria, and the MERIS sensor from the Envisat satellite has taken worldwide images at a high frequency for over 10 years. This short time lapse image collection has provided an extensive record of images for the analysis of variation in the cyanobacterial communities in water reservoirs for management and scientific purposes. The objective of this work is to determine the relationship between measured cyanobacterial biomass as biovolume and the estimations derived from MERIS imagery. This study encompasses two independent studies relying on data from 23 water reservoirs. First, a long-term global limnological research study was conducted that provided a field data collection that included cyanobacterial biovolume, among other variables. Second, a survey was conducted that applied the processed images derived from the Envisat MERIS sensor. The chlorophyll-a (Chl a) content and phycocyanin concentration (PC) were estimated from the MERIS images. The PC estimated by remote sensing and total cyanobacterial biovolume measured from the field samples were found to be significantly correlated (R2=0.6219; p{\textless}0.001). No relevant differences were found among the taxonomical groups, which indicated that this tool provides accurate estimations irrespective of the cyanobacterial group. For validation, the algorithm derived from the entire dataset was applied to the MERIS image dataset of the Rosarito reservoir. An estimated cyanobacterial biovolume time series was performed and compared to the biovolume data collected in an extensive sampling schedule spanning 4 years. The results indicated a strong correlation (R2=0.72; p{\textless}0.001) between the measured and estimated data acquired on the same day. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

The influence of Pacific tropical cyclones on cyanobacterial blooms in China's third largest lake, Taihu, was studied during the passage of two typhoons using a continuous monitoring as part of an on-lake high-frequency recording platform, coupled to satellite-based remote sensing data. Short-term (on the order of hours) nutrient pulsing resulting from the passage of typhoons played a key role in bloom initiation and maintenance. Decreasing wind speeds and increasing air and water temperatures in the aftermath of cyclones were accompanied by elevated phytoplankton biomass concentrations. The synergistic effects of nutrient pulsing, elevated water temperatures and increased water column stratification after the passage of the cyclones stimulated blooms of the toxic cyanobacteria Microcystis spp. There were short-term successions of blooms following typhoons, and as blooms "crashed" they provided nutrient inocula for future blooms. Trends determined from historical in situ data indicated higher frequencies and intensities of blooms in "cyclone years". Typhoons are an important driver of biogeochemical and water quality perturbations at the ecosystem-level in this hypertrophic lake. These events play a key role in our ability to forecast blooms over both short (days) and longer-term (weeks) periods.},

These challenges need the accurate determination of the water radiance, which is not often valued compared to other sources such as atmosphere and specular water reflection (sun glint). In this context, the atmospheric correction and the glinting removal have demonstrated to be critical steps in the preprocessing chain of high resolution images.

The results suggested that almost 60{\%} of these water bodies were supersaturated with CO2with respect to atmosphere, and the collected reservoirs samples exhibited higher mean pCO2than lakes. The mean pCO2in fresh water lakes was about 3.5 times of the value in saline lakes. The lakes and reservoirs were divided into five groups (Inner Mongolia -Xinjiang plateau region, Tibetan Plateau region, Northeastern plain and mountainous region, Yunnan- Guizhou Plateau region, and Eastern plain region). The Yunnan- Guizhou Plateau region showed the highest pCO2compared with other regions, most likely due to the typical karst landforms, karst processes may promote aqueous CO2concentration, and karstification has a significant effect on the capture of atmospheric CO2. Inner Mongolia-Xinjiang plateau and Tibetan Plateau region reserviors showed negative CO2flux to atmosphere, other waters in this study all supersaturated with CO2with respect to the atmosphere. A which We analyzed the relationship between pCO2and environmental variables, and results showed that some indicators had correlations with pCO2in individual region such as total phosphorus, dissolved organic matter, and total suspended solids, but the relationship could not be observed with all surveyed waters. This indicated that it might be much more effective in a smaller regional scale than the broadened scale when the environmental factors were used as the predictor of pCO2in lakes. Therefore, the common algorithm that extrapolates CO2concentration or emission flux from the study region to a wider scale might not be accurate because of the changes in the environmental and water quality conditions.},

abstract = {Present sun glint removal methods overcorrect data collected in very shallow (less than 2 m) waters if the sensors used do not have bands in far infrared part of the spectrum. The reason is assuming of zero water leaving signal at near infrared (NIR) wavelengths. This assumption is not valid in very shallow waters, but also in areas where aquatic vegetation reaches water surface and in case of phytoplankton blooms that reach very high biomass or form surface scum. We propose an alternative method that can be used for successful glint removal even if the sensor does not have spectral bands beyond 800 nm. The proposed method utilises the presence and depth of the oxygen absorption feature near 760 nm as an indicator of glint contamination.

abstract = {Transport of hydrophobic organic pollutants in rivers is mainly coupled to transport of suspended particles. Turbidity measurements are often used to assess the amount of suspended solids in water. In this study, a monitoring campaign is presented where the total concentration of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), the amount of total suspended solids (TSS), and turbidity was measured in water samples from five neighboring catchments in southwest Germany. Linear correlations of turbidity and TSS were obtained which were in close agreement to the literature data. From linear regressions of turbidity versus total PAH concentrations in water, mean concentrations of PAH on suspended particles could be calculated and these varied by catchment. These values furthermore comprise a robust measure of the average sediment quality in a given catchment. Since in the catchments investigated in this study, PAH concentrations on suspended particles were stable over a large turbidity range (1–114 Nephelometric Turbidity Units), turbidity could be used as a proxy for total PAHs and likely other highly hydrophobic organic pollutants in river water if the associated correlations are established. Based on that, online monitoring of turbidity (e.g., by optical backscattering sensors) seems very promising to determine annual pollutant fluxes.},

In this paper, a data-driven inland-lake eutrophication assessment method was proposed by using an articial neural network (ANN) to build relationships from remote sensing data and in-situ TLI sampling. In order to train the net, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS, which has a revisit cycle of 4 times per day) data were combined with in-situ observations. Results demonstrate that the TLI obtained directly from remote-sensing images using the data-driven method is more accurate than the TLI calculated from the water quality factors retrieved from remote-sensing images using a multivariate regression method. Spatially continuous and quasi-real time results were retrieved by using MODIS data. is method provides an ecient way to map the TLI spatial distribution in inland lakes, and provides a scheme for increased automation in TLI estimation.

abstract = {Over the last 50 years the effects of suspended solids (SS) on fish and aquatic life have been studied intensively throughout the world. It is now accepted that SS are an extremely important cause of water quality deterioration leading to aesthetic issues, higher costs of water treatment, a decline in the fisheries resource, and serious ecological degradation of aquatic environments. As such, government-led environmental bodies have set recommended water quality guidelines for concentrations of SS in freshwater systems. However, these reference values are often spurious or based on the concept of turbidity as a surrogate measure of the concentration of SS. The appropriateness of these recommended water quality values is evaluated given: (1) the large variability and uncertainty in data available from research describing the effects of SS on aquatic environments, (2) the diversity of environments that these values are expected to relate to, and (3) the range of conditions experienced within these environments. Furthermore, we suggest that reliance solely upon turbidity data as a surrogate for SS must be treated with caution, as turbidity readings respond to factors other than just concentrations of SS, as well as being influenced by the particle-size distribution and shape of SS particles. In addition, turbidity is a measure of only one of the many detrimental effects, reviewed in this paper, which high levels of SS can have in waterbodies. In order to improve the understanding of the effects of SS on aquatic organisms, this review suggests that: First, high-resolution turbidity monitoring should be supplemented with direct, measurements of SS (albeit at lower resolution due to resource issues). This would allow the turbidity record to be checked and calibrated against SS, effectively building a rating-relationship between SS and turbidity, which would in-turn provide a clearer picture of the exact magnitude of the SS problem. Second, SS should also be characterised in terms of their particle-size distribution and chemical composition. This would provide information to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the observed variable effects of a given concentration of SS in aquatic habitats. These two suggested improvements, combined with lower-resolution concurrent measures of aquatic ecological status, would improve our understanding of the effects of SS in aquatic environments and together with a more detailed classification of aquatic environments{\ldots}},

The Landsat data best correlated with the TSI values. Prediction models were developed to classify some 100 'test' lakes appearing in the two analysis scenes on the basis of TSI estimates. Clouds, wind, poor image data, small lake size, and shallow lake depth caused some problems in lake TSI prediction. Overall, however, the Landsat-predicted TSI estimates were judged to be very reliable for the secchi-derived TSI estimation, moderately reliable for prediction of the chlorophyll-a TSI, and unreliable for the phosphorous value. Numerous Landsat data extraction, procedures were compared, and the success of the Landsat TSI prediction models was a strong function of the procedure employed.

abstract = {We explore the role of lakes in carbon cycling and global climate, examine the mechanisms influencing carbon pools and transformations in lakes, and discuss how the metabolism of carbon in the inland waters is likely to change in response to climate. Furthermore, we project changes as global climate change in the abundance and spatial distribution of lakes in the biosphere, and we revise the estimate for the global extent of carbon transformation in inland waters. This synthesis demonstrates that the global annual emissions of carbon dioxide from inland waters to the atmosphere are similar in magnitude to the carbon dioxide uptake by the oceans and that the global burial of organic carbon in inland water sediments exceeds organic carbon sequestration on the ocean floor. The role of inland waters in global carbon cycling and climate forcing may be changed by human activities, including construction of impoundments, which accumulate large amounts of carbon in sediments and emit large amounts of methane to the atmosphere. Methane emissions are also expected from lakes on melting permafrost. The synthesis presented here indicates that (1) inland waters constitute a significant component of the global carbon cycle, (2) their contribution to this cycle has significantly changed as a result of human activities, and (3) they will continue to change in response to future climate change causing decreased as well as increased abundance of lakes as well as increases in the number of aquatic impoundments.},

abstract = {Many lakes in boreal and arctic regions have high concentrations of CDOM (coloured dissolved organic matter). Remote sensing of such lakes is complicated due to very low water leaving signals. There are extreme (black) lakes where the water reflectance values are negligible in almost entire visible part of spectrum (400-700 nm) due to the absorption by CDOM. In these lakes, the only water-leaving signal detectable by remote sensing sensors occurs as two peaks-near 710 nm and 810 nm. The first peak has been widely used in remote sensing of eutrophic waters for more than two decades. We show on the example of field radiometry data collected in Estonian and Swedish lakes that the height of the 810 nm peak can also be used in retrieving water constituents from remote sensing data. This is important especially in black lakes where the height of the 710 nm peak is still affected by CDOM. We have shown that the 810 nm peak can be used also in remote sensing of a wide variety of lakes. The 810 nm peak is caused by combined effect of slight decrease in absorption by water molecules and backscattering from particulate material in the water. Phytoplankton was the dominant particulate material in most of the studied lakes. Therefore, the height of the 810 peak was in good correlation with all proxies of phytoplankton biomass-chlorophyll-a (R2 = 0.77), total suspended matter (R2 = 0.70), and suspended particulate organic matter (R2 = 0.68). There was no correlation between the peak height and the suspended particulate inorganic matter. Satellite sensors with sufficient spatial and radiometric resolution for mapping lake water quality (Landsat 8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI) were launched recently. In order to test whether these satellites can capture the 810 nm peak we simulated the spectral performance of these two satellites from field radiometry data. Actual satellite imagery from a black lake was also used to study whether these sensors can detect the peak despite their band configuration. Sentinel 2 MSI has a nearly perfectly positioned band at 705 nm to characterize the 700-720 nm peak. We found that the MSI 783 nm band can be used to detect the 810 nm peak despite the location of this band is not in perfect to capture the peak.},

Applying a CDOM algorithm (ratio of green and red band reflectance) for two high spatial resolution multispectral GeoEye-1 and Worldview-2 satellite images, we were able to extrapolate the a($\lambda$)CDOM data from 18 lakes sampled in the field to 356 lakes in the study area (model R2 = 0.79). Values of a(440)CDOM in 356 lakes varied from 0.48 to 8.35 m−1 with a median of 1.43 m−1. This a($\lambda$)CDOM dataset was used to relate lake CDOM to 17 lake and lake catchment parameters derived from optical and radar remote sensing data and from digital elevation model analysis in order to establish the parameters controlling CDOM in lakes on the Yamal Peninsula. Regression tree model and boosted regression tree analysis showed that the activity of cryogenic processes (thermocirques) in the lake shores and lake water level were the two most important controls, explaining 48.4{\%} and 28.4{\%} of lake CDOM, respectively (R2 = 0.61). Activation of thermocirques led to a large input of terrestrial organic matter and sediments from catchments and thawed permafrost to lakes (n = 15, mean a(440)CDOM = 5.3 m−1). Large lakes on the floodplain with a connection to Mordy-Yakha River received more CDOM (n = 7, mean a(440)CDOM = 3.8 m−1) compared to lakes located on higher terraces.},

abstract = {A set of satellite images of chlorophyll a concentration for Lake Kinneret (Israel) from the period February to April 2007 captured the temporal evolution of horizontal patchiness that developed during the typical spring bloom of the dinoflagellate Peridinium gatunense. Narrow bands of high concentration located adjacent to the shoreline at the start of the bloom were followed by progressive propagation of this high-concentration region from the shoreline toward the center of the lake as the bloom proceeded. A three-dimensional (3-D) hydrodynamic numerical model and an analytical model for a flat-bottomed elliptical basin together explain the observed phenomenon. The spatial structure of Kelvin waves, which were demonstrated to most likely be present in February and April due to resonance, produced regions of high velocity gradient, contributing to horizontal dispersion close to the shoreline. This region of high dispersion was narrow and close to the shoreline at the start of the bloom when the Burger number was relatively small, but it widened over the course of the season as the Burger number increased due to increasing stratification. In addition, an increase in the dispersion rate with time in the lake interior was inferred from numerical simulation due to increasing wind speeds and a thinner surface layer. Physical processes, in this case, horizontal dispersion as a result of both Kelvin waves and wind, can play an important role in governing the dynamics and spatial evolution of dinoflagellate blooms in lakes.},

abstract = {Cyanobacterial blooms are an environmental issue that can cause health hazards by toxins and malodorous compounds. The pigment phycocyanin is indicative of cyanobacterial presence. In eutrophic inland waters in which nitrogen is not a limiting nutrient, the phycocyanin concentration (PC) is closely related to cyanobacterial biomass. This study proposes a simple semi-analytical four-band algorithm for PC estimation to overcome the deficiency of existing algorithms. This algorithm was calibrated using a data set collected from Lake Taihu in 2007. Optimal reference wavelengths for the algorithm were located through model tuning and accuracy optimization. The algorithm was evaluated for its accuracy against an independent data set collected in 2008. The performance of the algo- rithm was also compared with that of the nested band-ratio algorithm, which was developed for PC estimation in turbid waters. Although both algorithms enabled the establishment of a linear relationship betweenmeasured and predicted PC, the nested band-ratio algorithm did not have a satisfactory performance with either data set, having a high level of uncertainty. Its mean relative error stands at 51.07{\%} and 51{\%} for the 2007 and 2008 data sets, respectively. It accounted for 68{\%} and 74{\%} of the variation in PC in the 2007 and 2008 data sets, respectively. The four-band algorithmworkedwell in PC estimation. It accounted for 87{\%} of the variation in PC for the 2007 data set and 86{\%} of the variation in the 2008 data set. Furthermore, it decreased estimation uncertainty, compared with the nested band-ratio algorithm, by more than 20{\%}. The values of mean relative error for the correspondence data sets are 29.1{\%} and 30{\%}. Therefore, the proposed four-band algorithm holds great potential in estimating PC in highly turbid waters.},

abstract = {Freshwater ecosystems underpin global water and food security, yet are some of the most endangered ecosystems in the world because they are particularly vulnerable to land management change and climate variability. The US National Research Council's guidance to NASA regarding missions for the coming decade includes a polar orbiting, global mapping hyperspectral satellite remote sensing mission, the Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI), to make quantitative measurements of ecosystem change. Traditionally, freshwater ecosystems have been challenging to measure with satellite remote sensing because they are small and spatially complex, require high fidelity spectroradiometry, and are best described with biophysical variables derived from high spectral resolution data. In this study, we evaluate the contribution of a hyperspectral global mapping satellite mission to measuring freshwater ecosystems. We demonstrate the need for such a mission, and evaluate the suitability and gaps, through an examination of the measurement resolution issues impacting freshwater ecosystem measurements (spatial, temporal, spectral and radiometric). These are exemplified through three case studies that use remote sensing to characterize a component of freshwater ecosystems that drive primary productivity. The high radiometric quality proposed for the HyspIRI mission makes it uniquely well designed for measuring freshwater ecosystems accurately at moderate to high spatial resolutions. The spatial and spectral resolutions of the HyspIRI mission are well suited for the retrieval of multiple biophysical variables, such as phycocyanin and chlorophyll-a. The effective temporal resolution is suitable for characterizing growing season wetland phenology in temperate regions, but may not be appropriate for tracking algal bloom dynamics, or ecosystem responses to extreme events in monsoonal regions. Global mapping missions provide the systematic, repeated measurements necessary to measure the drivers of freshwater biodiversity change. Archival global mapping missions with open access and free data policies increase end user uptake globally.

This study provides the first rigorous, quantitative evaluation of global relationships between the NDVI and geographically representative vegetation data-bases, including field metabolic measurements and carbon-balance results from global simulation models. Geographic reliability of the NDVI is judged by comparing NDVI values for different surface types with a general global trend and by statistical analysis of relationships to biomass amounts, net and gross primary productivity, and actual evapotranspiration. NDVI data appear to be relatively reliable predictors of primary productivity except in areas of complex terrain, for seasonal values at high latitudes, and in extreme deserts. The strength of the NDVI-productivity relationship seems comparable to that of earlier climate-based productivity models. Little consistent relationship was found, across different vegetation types, between NDVI and biomass amounts or net biospheric CO2 flux.},

abstract = {Accurate remote retrieval of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations for inland and coastal turbid waters is a challenging task due to their optical complexity. An adaptive model was developed based on the merits of coupling a genetic algorithm to select spectral variables and partial least squares (GA-PLS) for regression. The objectives of this paper are: (1) to evaluate the GA-PLS model performance using datasets collected from 1140 stations encompassing a wide range of Chl-a and suspended sediment from nine water bodies across Central Indiana (CIN), USA, South Australia (SA), Taihu Lake (THL) in East China and Shitoukoumen Reservoir (STKR) in Northeast China with comparison to a widely accepted three-band model, and (2) to evaluate the GA-PLS spatial transferability with simulated ESA/Sentinel3/OLCI and Hyperion spectra. The GA-PLS and the three-band model yield accurate calibrations (Cal) for the SA dataset with R2above 0.98, and the corresponding validation (Val) shows relative root mean squared error (rRMSE) of less than 6.2{\%} with narrow-band spectra. Both the GA-PLS and three-band model show stable performance for the CIN dataset (Cal: R2=0.91 and 0.77; Val: rRMSE=20.1{\%} and 33.4{\%}), THL dataset (Cal: R2=0.91 and 0.88; Val: rRMSE=30.1{\%} and 33.7{\%}), and STKR dataset (R2=0.84 and 0.82; rRMSE=29.1{\%} and 33.2{\%}). The results also reveal that simulated OLCI datasets degrade both the GA-PLS performance, and particularly the performance of the three-band model due to the coarser and discontinuous spectral configuration. Contrastingly, both the GA-PLS and the three-band model show improved results with the simulated Hyperion datasets. Our observation indicates that the GA-PLS model outperforms the three-band model in terms of spatial transferability; however, the three-band model has its own merits, considering its simplicity. Further analyses indicate that spectral measurement protocols, instrumentations, and inorganic suspended matter affect the GA-PLS and three-band model performances. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

Thus, the advantage of using MSS is the ability to monitor large areas with significantly less data. TM data can be efficiently used to monitor smaller lakes and reservoirs. TM Band 1 reflectance was the only Landsat data that accounted for at least 50{\%} of the variability in the chlorophyll data. This would not be adequate for a monitoring program for chlorophyll in sediment dominated lakes, such as Moon Lake. TM thermal data were highly correlated with surface water temperature. TM measured surface water temperatures could be useful in determining water balance in small agricultural reservoirs.

One of the awarded projects focused on the flight transects covering the coastal ocean to demonstrate that the AVIRIS data can be used to infer phytoplankton functional types at the land-sea interface. Specifically, this project directly assesses whether HyspIRI can provide adequate signal in the complex aquatic environment of the coastal zone to address questions of algal bloom dynamics, water quality, transient responses to human disturbance, river runoff, and red tides. Phytoplankton functional type (PFT), or biodiversity, can be determined from ocean color using the Phytoplankton Detection with Optics (PHYDOTax) algorithm and this information can be used to detect and monitor for harmful algal blooms. PHYDOTax is sensitive to spectral shape and accurate retrievals of ocean color across the visible spectral range is needed. The specific goal of this paper is to address the challenges of sensor capabilities and atmospheric correction in coastal environments by assessing two atmospheric correction methods using AVIRIS data for the retrieval of ocean color for use in derived products of chlorophyll-a and phytoplankton functional type. The atmospheric correction algorithms Atmospheric Removal (ATREM) and Tafkaa were applied to AVIRIS imagery of Monterey Bay, CA collected on 10 April 2013 and 31 October 2013. Data products from the imagery were compared with shipboard measurements including chlorophyll-a from whole-water samples and phytoplankton community structure estimated from diagnostic pigment markers using CHEMical TAXonomy (CHEMTAX). Using ATREM and Tafkaa and a selected set of input parameters for the scenes, we were unable to produce accurate retrievals of ocean color for the determination of chlorophyll-a and phytoplankton diversity.

CTSI has been modified for the study area and is used in this study. Satellite imagery analysis now plays a prominent role in the quick assessment of water quality in a vast area. This study is an attempt to assess the trophic state index based on secchi disk depth and chlorophyll a of a lake system (Akkulam-Veli lake, Kerala, India) using Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) P6 LISS III imagery. Field data were collected on the date of the overpass of the satellite. Multiple regression equation is found to yield superior results than the simple regression equations using spectral ratios and radiance from the individual bands, for the prediction of trophic state index from satellite imagery. The trophic state index based on secchi disk depth, derived from the satellite imagery, provides an accurate prediction of the trophic status of the lake. IRS P6-LISS III imagery can be effectively used for the assessment of the trophic condition of a lake system.},

abstract = {The growing number of narrow spectral bands in hyperspectral remote sensing improves the capacity to describe and predict biological processes in ecosystems. But it also poses a challenge to fit empirical models based on such high dimensional data, which often contain correlated and noisy predictors. As sample sizes, to train and validate empirical models, seem not to be increasing at the same rate, overfitting has become a serious concern. Overly complex models lead to overfitting by capturing more than the underlying relationship, and also through fitting random noise in the data. Many regression techniques claim to overcome these problems by using different strategies to constrain complexity, such as limiting the number of terms in the model, by creating latent variables or by shrinking parameter coefficients. This paper is proposing a new method, named Na{\"{i}}ve Overfitting Index Selection (NOIS), which makes use of artificially generated spectra, to quantify the relative model overfitting and to select an optimal model complexity supported by the data. The robustness of this new method is assessed by comparing it to a traditional model selection based on cross-validation. The optimal model complexity is determined for seven different regression techniques, such as partial least squares regression, support vector machine, artificial neural network and tree-based regressions using five hyperspectral datasets. The NOIS method selects less complex models, which present accuracies similar to the cross-validation method. The NOIS method reduces the chance of overfitting, thereby avoiding models that present accurate predictions that are only valid for the data used, and too complex to make inferences about the underlying process.},

It assesses the indicator strength of these metrics, specifically in relation to representing the impacts of eutrophication.

On the basis of this analysis, three of the strongest metrics (chlorophyll-a, phytoplankton trophic index (PTI), and cyanobacterial biovolume) are recommended for use as robust measures for assessing the ecological quality of lakes in relation to nutrient-enrichment pressures and a minimum recommended sampling frequency is provided for these three metrics.},

The procedure is designed for MERIS, the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer, which will be flown onboard the Earth observation satellite Envisat of the European Space Agency (ESA). The algorithm is a neural network (NN) which is used to parameterize the inverse of a radiative transfer model. It is used in this study as a multiple nonlinear regression technique. The NN is a feedforward backpropagation model with two hidden layers. The NN was trained with computed reflectances covering the range of 0.5-50 mu g1(-1) phytoplankton pigment, 1-100mg1(-1) suspended matter, gelbstoff absorption at 420 nm of 0.02-2m(-1) and a horizontal visibility of 2-50 km. Inputs to the NN are the reflectances of the 16 spectral channels which were under discussion for MERIS. The outputs are the three water constituent concentrations and the aerosol concentration, here expressed as the horizontal ground visibility. Tests with simulated reflectances show: (1) that concentations are correctly retrieved for a wide range covering oligotrophic Case I and turbid Case II water; (2) that the atmospheric correction can be performed even over very turbid water where the reflectance of the water cannot be neglected for the atmospheric correction channels in the near-infrared spectral range; and (3) that the algorithm is robust against errors in the input data. Although the training of the NN is time consuming, the utilization of the NN algorithm is extremely fast and can be applied routinely for satellite data mass production.},

Starting from a collaboration with a worldwide famous Italian designer, we defined a NUI to explore 360 panoramic artworks presented on wall-sized displays, like virtual reconstruction of ancient cultural sites, or rendering of imaginary places. Specifically, we let the user to "move the head" as way of natural interaction to explore and navigate through these large digital artworks. To this aim, we developed a system including a remote head pose estimator to catch movements of users standing in front of the wall-sized display: starting from a central comfort zone, as users move their head in any direction, the virtual camera rotates accordingly. With NUIs, it is difficult to get feedbacks from the users about the interest for the point of the artwork he/she is looking at. To solve this issue, we complemented the gaze estimator with a preliminary emotional analysis solution, able to implicitly infer the interest of the user for the shown content from his/her pupil size. A sample of 150 subjects was invited to experience the proposed interface at an International Design Week. Preliminary results show that the most of the subjects were able to properly interact with the system from the very first use, and that the emotional module is an interesting solution, even if further work must be devoted to address specific situations. {\textcopyright} 2016 for this paper by its authors.

Water clarity, measured as vertical attenuation coefficient (K(d)), varied between 0.1 and 0.4 m-1 and there was a period of prolonged low clarity in the middle of the study. Characean meadows extended to a maximum depth of over 30 m at the start of the study in April 1993 but were reduced to less than 20 m by July 1995. At depths of 5, 10 and 15m, where characean meadows persisted through to July 1995, there was a change in species composition, with an upward shift in the proportions of dominant taxa. This change was manifested as an increase in the percentage contribution to biomass of Chara globularis and Chara corallina at the expense of Chara fibrosa. Over the entire study period characean biomass remained maximal at depths of 5 and 10 m at approximately 180 g (dry weight) m-2. At a depth of 5 m, biomass was not affected by changing water clarity and appeared to be limited by exposure to wave action and variable water level. At depths greater than 10 m, biomass declined significantly over the study period of 2 years. Reductions could be related to the underwater light field which plants experienced over the period between each sampling. Total characean biomass declined below maximal when irradiance fell below 1.0 mol m-2 day-1. Despite an increase in water clarity in early 1995, recovery of biomass was not observed within the time scale of this study.},

abstract = {Learning incorporates a broad range of complex procedures. Machine learning (ML) is a subdivision of artificial intelligence based on the biological learning process. The ML approach deals with the design of algorithms to learn from machine readable data. ML covers main domains such as data mining, difficult-to-program applications, and software applications. It is a collection of a variety of algorithms (e.g. neural networks, support vector machines, self-organizing map, decision trees, random forests, case-based reasoning, genetic programming, etc.) that can provide multivariate, nonlinear, nonparametric regression or classification. The modeling capabilities of the ML-based methods have resulted in their extensive applications in science and engineering. Herein, the role of ML as an effective approach for solving problems in geosciences and remote sensing will be highlighted. The unique features of some of the ML techniques will be outlined with a specific attention to genetic programming paradigm. Furthermore, nonparametric regression and classification illustrative examples are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of ML for tackling the geosciences and remote sensing problems.},

abstract = {Eutrophication and cyanobacterial algal blooms present an increasing threat to the health of freshwater ecosystems and to humans who use these resources for drinking and recreation. Remote sensing is being used increasingly as a tool for monitoring these phenomena in inland and near-coastal waters. This study uses the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) to view Zeekoevlei, a small hypertrophic freshwater lake situated on the Cape Flats in Cape Town, South Africa, dominated by Microcystis cyanobacteria. The lake's small size, highly turbid water, and covariant water constituents present a challenging case for both algorithm development and atmospheric correction. The objectives of the study are to assess the optical properties of the lake, to evaluate various atmospheric correction procedures, and to compare the performance of empirical and semi-analytical algorithms in hypertrophic water. In situ water quality parameter and radiometric measurements were made simultaneous to MERIS overpasses. Upwelling radiance measurements at depth 0.66m were corrected for instrument self-shading and processed to water-leaving reflectance using downwelling irradiance measurements and estimates of the vertical attenuation coefficient for upward radiance, Ku, generated from a simple bio-optical model estimating the total absorption, a($\Lambda$), and backscattering coefficients, bb($\Lambda$). The normalised water-leaving reflectance was used for assessing the accuracy of image-based Dark Object Subtraction and 6S Radiative Transfer Code atmospheric correction procedures applied to MERIS. Empirical algorithms for estimating chlorophyll a (Chl a), Total Suspended Solids (TSS), Secchi Disk depth (zSD) and absorption by CDOM (aCDOM) were derived from simultaneously collected in situ and MERIS measurements. The empirical algorithms gave high correlation coefficient values, although they have a limited ability to separate between signals from covariant water constituents. The MERIS Neural Network algorithms utilised in the standard Level 2 Case 2 waters product and Eutrophic Lakes processor were also used to derive water constituent concentrations. However, these failed to produce reasonable comparisons with in situ measurements owing to the failure of atmospheric correction and divergence between the optical properties and ranges used to train the algorithms and those of Zeekoevlei. Maps produced using the empirical algorithms effectively show the spatial and temporal variability {\ldots}},

The variations in the absorption characteristics of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM), phytoplankton, and non-algal particles (NAP) and their relative contributions to total absorption among these waters were analyzed. The obtained results indicated that these areas are representative of the optically complex inland waters characterized by strong regional variations of their absorption properties. By means of the relative contributions of NAP and phytoplankton to the total water absorption at 550 and 675 nm, these waters were classified into three optical water types, each one having specific biogeochemical and optical properties. Two of the types were distinct and corresponded to waters that are optically controlled by NAP (Type I) and dominated by phytoplankton (Type III). Type II was related to relatively optically mixed waters where the absorption properties are controlled by NAP and phytoplankton. Additionally, the differences in remote-sensing reflectance (Rrs) spectra among the three classified water types were clarified to establish optical criteria for identifying these water types. On this basis, the classification criteria for MERIS images were developed, which allowed one to cluster every Rrs spectrum into one of the three water types by comparing the values from band 6, band 8, and band 9 of MERIS images. The proposed criteria were subsequently conducted to map the water types of Lake Taihu using MERIS images.},

In lake models , one essential parameter is water clarity , parameterized via the light extinction coefficient , K d , for which a global constant value is usually used . We used direct eddy covariance fluxes and basic meteorological measurements coupled with lake water temperature and clarity measurements from a boreal lake to estimate the performance of two lake models , LAKE and FLake . These models represent two 1 - D modeling frameworks broadly used in NWP . The results show that the lake models are very sensitive to changes in K d when it is lower than 0 . 5 m {\`{A}}1 . The progress of thermal stratification depended strongly on K d . In dark - water simulations the mixed layer was shallower , longwave and turbulent heat losses higher , and therefore the average water column temperatures lower than in clear - water simulations . Thus , changes in water clarity can also affect the onset of ice cover . The more complex LAKE modeled the seasonal thermocline deepening , whereas it remained virtually constant during summer in the FLake model . Both models overestimated the surface water temperatures by about 1°C and latent heat flux by {\textgreater}30{\%} , but the variations in heat storage and sensible heat flux were adequately simulated . Our results suggest that , at least for humic lakes , a lake - specific , but not time - depending , constant value for K d can be used and that a global mapping of K d would be most beneficial in regions with relatively clear lakes , e . g . , in lakes at high altitudes .},

abstract = {A novel algorithm is presented for detecting trophic status (chlorophyll-a), cyanobacterial blooms, surface scum and floating vegetation in coastal and inland waters using top-of-atmosphere data from the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS). The maximum peak-height algorithm (MPH) uses a baseline subtraction procedure to calculate the height of the dominant peak across the red and near-infrared MERIS bands between 664 and 885nm caused by sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SICF) and particulate backscatter. Atmospheric correction of the MERIS TOA reflectance data for gaseous absorption and Rayleigh scattering proved adequate given the spectral proximity of the relevant bands and the sufficiently large differential spectral signal. This avoided the need to correct for atmospheric aerosols, a procedure which is typically prone to large errors in turbid and high-biomass waters. A combination of switching algorithms for estimating chl-a were derived from coincident in situ chl-a and MERIS bottom-of-Rayleigh reflectance measurements. These algorithms are designed to cover a wide trophic range, from oligotrophic/mesotrophic waters (chl-a{\textless}20mgm-3), to eutrophic/hypertrophic waters (chl-a{\textgreater}20mgm-3) and surface scums or dry floating algae or vegetation. Cyanobacteria-dominant waters were differentiated from those dominated by eukaryote algal species (dinoflagellates/diatoms) on the basis of the magnitude of the MPH variable. This is supported by evidence that vacuolate cyanobacteria (Microcystis aeruginosa) possess enhanced chl-a specific backscatter which is an important bio-optical distinguishing feature. This enables these phytoplankton groups to be distinguished from space. An algorithm derived from cyanobacteria-dominant waters had a r2value of 0.58 for chl-a between 33 and 362mgm-3and an error of 33.7{\%} (N=17). The operational algorithm for eukaryote-dominant algal assemblages gave a coefficient of determination of 0.71 and a mean absolute percentage error of 60{\%} for chl-a in the range 0.5-350mgm-3(N=48). A flag based on cyanobacteria-specific spectral pigmentation and fluorescence features was used to identify cyanobacterial-dominance in eutrophic waters. Global applications demonstrate how the MPH algorithm can offer rapid and effective assessment of trophic status, cyanobacterial-dominance, surface scums and floating vegetation in inland and coastal waters. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Cost-effective monitoring is necessary for all investigations of lake ecosystem responses to perturbations and long-term change. Satellite imagery offers the opportunity to extend low-cost monitoring and to examine spatial and temporal variability in water clarity data. We have developed automated procedures using Landsat imagery to estimate total suspended sediments (TSS), turbidity (TURB) in nephlometric turbidity units (NTU) and Secchi disc transparency (SDT) in 34 shallow lakes in the Waikato region, New Zealand, over a 10-year time span. Fifty-three Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus images captured between January 2000 and March 2009 were used for the analysis, six of which were captured within 24 h of physical in situ measurements for each of 10 shallow lakes. This gave 32-36 usable data points for the regressions between surface reflectance signatures and in situ measurements, which yielded r (2) values ranging from 0.67 to 0.94 for the three water clarity variables. Using these regressions, a series of Arc Macro Language scripts were developed to automate image preparation and water clarity analysis. Minimum and maximum in situ measurements corresponding to the six images were 2 and 344 mg/L for TSS, 75 and 275 NTU for TURB, and 0.05 and 3.04 m for SDT. Remotely sensed water clarity estimates showed good agreement with temporal patterns and trends in monitored lakes and we have extended water clarity datasets to previously unmonitored lakes. High spatial variability of TSS and water clarity within some lakes was apparent, highlighting the importance of localised inputs and processes affecting lake clarity. Moreover, remote sensing can give a whole lake view of water quality, which is very difficult to achieve by in situ point measurements.},

Satellite remote sensing has the potential to resolve this problem. We carried out model simulations to evaluate the suitability of different satellite sensors (Landsat, IKONOS, and the Advanced land Imager [ALI]) to map the amount of CDOM in concen- tration ranges that occur in boreal lakes of the Nordic countries. The results showed that the 8-bit radiometric resolution of Landsat 7 is not adequate when absorption by CDOM at 420 nm is higher than 3 m)1. On the other hand, the 16-bit radio- metric resolution of ALI, a prototype of the next generation of Landsat, is suitable for mapping CDOM in a wider range of concentrations. An ALI image of southern Finland was acquired on 14 July 2002 and in situ measurements were carried out in 15 lakes (18 stations). The results showed that there is a high correlation (R2 = 0.84) between the 565 nm/660 nm ALI band ratio and the CDOM absorption coefficient in lakes. Analysis of 245 lakes in the acquired satellite image showed a normal distribution of CDOM concentration among the lakes. However, the size distribution of lakes was highly skewed toward small lakes, resulting in the CDOM concentration per unit lake area being skewed toward high values. We showed that re- mote sensing enables synoptic monitoring of the CDOM concentration in a large number of lakes and thus enables scaling up to the level of large ecosystems and biome},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 Taylor {\&} Francis.Many studies have shown the considerable potential for the application of remote-sensing-based methods for deriving estimates of lake water quality. However, the reliable application of these methods across time and space is complicated by the diversity of lake types, sensor configuration, and the multitude of different algorithms proposed. This study tested one operational and 46 empirical algorithms sourced from the peer-reviewed literature that have individually shown potential for estimating lake water quality properties in the form of chlorophyll-a (algal biomass) and Secchi disc depth (SDD) (water transparency) in independent studies. Nearly half (19) of the algorithms were unsuitable for use with the remote-sensing data available for this study. The remaining 28 were assessed using the Terra/Aqua satellite archive to identify the best performing algorithms in terms of accuracy and transferability within the period 2001–2004 in four test lakes, namely V{\"{a}}nern, V{\"{a}}ttern, Geneva, and Balaton. These lakes represent the broad continuum of large European lake types, varying in terms of eco-region (latitude/longitude and altitude), morphology, mixing regime, and trophic status. All algorithms were tested for each lake separately and combined to assess the degree of their applicability in ecologically different sites. None of the algorithms assessed in this study exhibited promise when all four lakes were combined into a single data set and most algorithms performed poorly even for specific lake types. A chlorophyll-a retrieval algorithm originally developed for eutrophic lakes showed the most promising results (R{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} = 0.59) in oligotrophic lakes. Two SDD retrieval algorithms, one originally developed for turbid lakes and the other for lakes with various characteristics, exhibited promising results in relatively less turbid lakes (R{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} = 0.62 and 0.76, respectively). The results presented here highlight the complexity associated with remotely sensed lake water quality estimates and the high degree of uncertainty due to various limitations, including the lake water optical properties and the choice of methods.},

We used chlorophyll-a concentration data from the 2007 National Lake Assessment (NLA) (lake N = 1157) by the US Environmental Protection Agency to train and test Landsat TM/ETM+ algorithms. Results showed significant improvements in chlorophyll-a retrieval accuracy using machine-learning algorithms compared with traditional empirical models using linear regression. Specifically, the results from boosted regression trees and random forest explained, respectively, 45.8{\%} and 44.5{\%} of chlorophyll-a variation. Multiple linear regression could only explain 39.8{\%} of chlorophyll-a variation. The chlorophyll-a concentration derived from Landsat TM/ETM+ and a simple to use Google Earth Engine application, accurately characterized a 2009 algal bloom in western Lake Erie to show the model worked well for the analysis of temporal changes in algal conditions. Compared with chlorophyll-a data from the NLA, chlorophyll-a measurements with our Landsat TM/ETM+ model had almost the same correlation with lake's total phosphorus concentrations, especially when using multiple Landsat images. Therefore, Landsat measurements of chlorophyll-a have value for ecological assessments and managing algal problems in lakes.},

abstract = {The importance of lakes and reservoirs leads to the high need for monitoring lake water quality both at local and global scales. The aim of the study was to test suitability of Sentinel-2 Multispectral Imager's (MSI) data for mapping different lake water quality parameters. In situ data of chlorophyll a (Chl a), water color, colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from nine small and two large lakes were compared with band ratio algorithms derived from Sentinel-2 Level-1C and atmospherically corrected (Sen2cor) Level-2A images. The height of the 705 nm peak was used for estimating Chl a. The suitability of the commonly used green to red band ratio was tested for estimating the CDOM, DOC and water color. Concurrent reflectance measurements were not available. Therefore, we were not able to validate the performance of Sen2cor atmospheric correction available in the Sentinel-2 Toolbox. The shape and magnitude of water reflectance were consistent with our field measurements from previous years. However, the atmospheric correction reduced the correlation between the band ratio algorithms and water quality parameters indicating the need in better atmospheric correction. We were able to show that there is good correlation between band ratio algorithms calculated from Sentinel-2 MSI data and lake water parameters like Chl a (R2 = 0.83), CDOM (R2 = 0.72) and DOC (R2 = 0.92) concentrations as well as water color (R2 = 0.52). The in situ dataset was limited in number, but covered a reasonably wide range of optical water properties. These preliminary results allow us to assume that Sentinel-2 will be a valuable tool for lake monitoring and research, especially taking into account that the data will be available routinely for many years, the imagery will be frequent, and free of charge.},

Chl a was derived using red band reflectance of Landsat satellite images for 76 lakes, which were then averaged for each year to produce a landscape median for summer (August) over a 20-year period from 1984 and 2003. Our results showed that climate was related to interannual changes in trophic status. Average May temperature was positively correlated to Chl a, suggesting the importance of conditions in the early part of the growing season. Growing season effective precipitation (P – PET) was negatively correlated to Chl a such that wetter conditions seemed to lead to a dilution of Chl a. Very wet years resulted in a larger Chl a drop than one expected by a linear model, suggesting greater water contribution from the landscape. P – PET explained 64{\%} of the variance in Chl a using a nonlinear regression tree. Our study offers clues as to how shallow lake systems may behave on the subhumid Boreal Plain as a function of future climate change.},

In this study, an approach based on Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis has been developed and validated to estimate chlorophyll a concentrations (Chla, $\mu$g/L) in surface waters of Taihu Lake, the third largest freshwater lake in China. The EOF approach analyzed the spectral variance of normalized Rayleigh-corrected reflectance (Rrc) data at 469, 555, 645, and 859 nm, and subsequently related that variance to Chla using 28 concurrent MODIS and field measurements. This empirical algorithm was then validated using another 30 independent concurrent MODIS and field measurements. Image analysis and radiative transfer simulations indicated that the algorithm appeared to be tolerant to aerosol perturbations, with unbiased RMS uncertainties of {\textless}80{\%} for Chla ranging between 3 and 100 $\mu$g/L. Application of the algorithm to a total of 853 MODIS images between 2000 and 2013 under cloud-free conditions revealed spatial distribution patterns and seasonal changes that are consistent to previous findings based on floating algae mats. The current study can provide additional quantitative estimates of Chla that can be assimilated in an existing forecast model, which showed improved performance over the use of a previous Chla algorithm. However, the empirical nature, relatively large uncertainties, and limited number of spectral bands all point to the need of further improvement in data availability and accuracy with future satellite sensors.},

abstract = {The present study was carried out in Haraz basin (Iran) that is located in south of the Caspian Sea. The goal of this study was to establish correlations amongst total suspended solids concentration (TSS) and turbidity with total pollutant concentrations to evaluate the dissolved and particle-bound concentrations of major toxic metals. It also aimed to validate TSS and/or turbidity measurements as proxies to monitor pollutant fluxes. Eight metals, namely nickel, lead, cadmium, copper, zinc, cobalt, arsenic and strontium were analyzed for dissolved and total concentrations in water at ten locations within the catchment. TSS and turbidity were also measured. Sampling campaigns were designed to cover both the rainy (December) and the dry (May) season within the basin. The robust relationship between TSS (202-1212 mg/l) and turbidity (63-501 NTUs) in both seasons warranted their interchangeable potential as proxies within the observed ranges. Total element concentrations were plotted in separate attempts versus TSS and turbidity for all locations and both events. Very good linear correlations were attained where the slopes represent the metals concentration on suspended solids and the intercept the dissolved concentration in water. The results achieved by these linear regressions were in very good agreement with independently measured values for dissolved concentration and concentrations on river bed sediments taken at the same locations. This demonstrates that turbidity and/or TSS measurements may be used for monitoring of metal loads if once calibrated against total concentration of metals. The results also revealed that in the lower Haraz catchment metal concentrations on suspended and river bed sediment were homogeneously distributed along the investigated river stretch. This is assumed to be due to intensive gravel and sand mining activities in the upper and middle part of the catchment.},

abstract = {The second generation of ocean-color-analyzing instruments requires more accurate atmospheric correction than does the Coastal Zone Color Scanner (CZCS), if one is to utilize fully their increased radiometric sensitivity. Unlike the CZCS, the new instruments possess bands in the near infrared (NIR) that are solely for aiding atmospheric correction. We show, using aerosol models, that certain assumptions regarding the spectral behavior of the aerosol reflectance employed in the standard CZCS correction algorithm are not valid over the spectral range encompassing both the visible and the NIR. Furthermore, we show that multiple-scattering effects on the algorithm depend significantly on the aerosol model. Following these observations, we propose an algorithm that utilizes the NIR bands for atmospheric correction to the required accuracy. Examples of the dependence of the error on the aerosol model, the turbidity of the atmosphere, and surface roughness (waves) are provided. The error in the retrieved phytoplankton-pigment concentration (the principal product of ocean-color sensors) induced by errors in the atmospheric correction are shown to be {\textless}20{\%} in approximately 90{\%} of the cases examined. Finally, the aerosol thickness ($\tau$($\alpha$)) is estimated through a simple extension of the correction algorithm. Simulations suggest that the error in the recovered value of $\tau$($\alpha$) should be ≲ 10{\%}.},

abstract = {Various types of floating algae have been reported in open oceans and coastal waters, yet accurate and timely detection of these relatively small surface features using traditional satellite data and algorithms has been difficult or even impossible due to lack of spatial resolution, coverage, revisit frequency, or due to inherent algorithm limitations. Here, a simple ocean color index, namely the Floating Algae Index (FAI), is developed and used to detect floating algae in open ocean environments using the medium-resolution (250- and 500-m) data from operational MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) instruments. FAI is defined as the difference between reflectance at 859 nm (vegetation "red edge") and a linear baseline between the red band (645 nm) and short-wave infrared band (1240 or 1640 nm). Through data comparison and model simulations, FAI has shown advantages over the traditional NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) or EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index) because FAI is less sensitive to changes in environmental and observing conditions (aerosol type and thickness, solar/viewing geometry, and sun glint) and can "see" through thin clouds. The baseline subtraction method provides a simple yet effective means for atmospheric correction, through which floating algae can be easily recognized and delineated in various ocean waters, including the North Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico, Yellow Sea, and East China Sea. Because similar spectral bands are available on many existing and planned satellite sensors such as Landsat TM/ETM+ and VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imager/Radiometer Suite), the FAI concept is extendable to establish a long-term record of these ecologically important ocean plants. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The lakes of the European perialpine region constitute a large water reservoir, which is threatened by the anthropogenic pressure altering water quality. The Water Framework Directive of the European Commission aims to protect water resources and monitoring is seen as an essential step for achieving this goal. Remote sensing can provide frequent data for large scale studies of water quality parameters such as chlorophyll-a (chl-a). In this work we use a dataset of maps of chl-a derived from over 200 MERIS (MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer) satellite images for comparing water quality of 12 perialpine lakes in the period 2003-2009. Besides the different trophic levels of the lakes, results confirm that the seasonal variability of chl-a concentration is particularly pronounced during spring and autumn especially for the more eutrophic lakes. We show that relying on only one sample for the assessment of lake water quality during the season might lead to misleading results and erroneous assignments to quality classes. Time series MERIS data represents a suitable and cost-effective technology to fill this gap, depicting the dynamics of the surface waters of lakes in agreement with the evolution of natural phenomena. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

This hypothesis was tested using remote sensing data. We used estimated Secchi disk transparency derived from reflected light measured by Landsat satellite photosensors. Lake trophic state indices (TSI) were estimated from the transparency estimates. Because alternate stable state theory is typically applied to productive lakes, we predicted that planktonic primary productivity would be especially bimodal in the small and shallow eutrophic lakes of southern Wisconsin. We found that overall, trophic state for over 8000 lakes in Wisconsin was multimodal (at least bimodal). Frequency distributions for lake size categories appeared to be distinctly bimodal. The largest and smallest lakes for all of Wisconsin had significantly bimodal curves, and southern (more productive) lakes had a more distinct multimodal curve than northern lakes. These results support the basic predictions of alternate stable state theory. The significantly trimodal distribution for southern lakes suggests that they may exist in more than just two alternate stable states.},

The radiance variables evaluated included the red and photographic infrared (IR) radiance and the linear combinations of the IR/red ratio, the square root of the IR/red ratio, the IR-red difference, the vegetation index, and the transformed vegetation index. In addition, the corresponding green and red linear combinations were evaluated for comparative purposes. Three data sets were used from June, September, and October sampling periods. Regression analysis showed the increased utility of the IR and red linear combinations vis-{\`{a}}-vis the same green and red linear combinations. The red and IR linear combinations had 7{\%} and 14{\%} greater regression significance than the green and red linear combinations for the June and September sampling periods, respectively. The vegetation index, transformed vegetation index, and square root of the IR/red ratio were the most significant, followed closely by the IR/red ratio. Less than a 6{\%} difference separated the highest and lowest of these four ER and red linear combinations. The use of these linear combinations was shown to be sensitive primarily to the green leaf area or green leaf biomass. As such, these linear combinations of the red and photographic IR radiances can be employed to monitor the photosynthetically active biomass of plant canopies. {\textcopyright} 1979.},

Using MODIS-Aqua measurements from 2002 to 2010, seasonal and spatial distributions of the normalized water-leaving radiance nL(w)(lambda) spectra from visible to the near-infrared (NIR) and SWIR (1240 nm) are derived and used for study and characterization of Lake Taihu water optical properties. In particular, for the first time, spatial and seasonal variations of nL(w)(lambda) at the SWIR 1240 nm (nL(w)(1240)) are derived for the lake and show some different features from those of the red and NIR nL(w)(lambda) (nL(w)(645) and nL(w)(859)). Time series of monthly MODIS-derived nL(w)(lambda) spectra for Lake Taihu are obtained and analyzed, showing important seasonal and interannual variations. The results indicate that the SWIR nL(w)(1240) contributions in the lake are mainly due to the presence of significant amounts of algae, while the red and NIR nL(w)(lambda) variations result from changes of total suspended sediment (TSS) amounts in the water column. Furthermore, this study shows that all three SWIR bands at 1240, 1640, and 2130 nm are useful and required for satellite water quality remote sensing for extremely turbid near-shore and inland waters.},

Simultaneous measurements of turbidity depth-profile and above-water spectral reflectance integrated according Landsat 7 ETM+ band 2 spectral sensitivity provide a linear regression relationship for the southwest lagoon of New Caledonia (r2=0.95, n=40). This relationship is applied to an empirically atmospherically corrected Landsat ETM+ image of the lagoon acquired on October 23, 2002. A comparison between Landsat estimates of turbidity and concurrent measurements at 14 stations indicates that the mean standard error in the satellite-estimated turbidity is 17.5{\%}. The numerical model introduced in Douillet et al. (2001) is used to simulate the transport of fine suspended sediments in the lagoon in October 2002. A calibration of the erosion rate coefficient required by the model is proposed using in situ turbidity profiles and the remotely sensed turbidity field. In situ data are used to tune locally the erosion rate coefficient, while satellite data are used to determine its spatial zonation. We discuss necessary improvements in coupled studies of fine-sediment transport in coastal zones, namely relationships between turbidity and sediment concentration, integration of wave influence in the model, and correction of bottom reflection in satellite data processing.},

abstract = {Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive, fatal neurodegenerative disease with a lifetime risk of developing as 1 in 700. Despite many recent discoveries about the genetics of ALS, the etiology of sporadic ALS remains largely unknown with gene-environment interaction suspected as a driver. Water quality and the toxin beta methyl-amino-alanine produced by cyanobacteria are suspected environmental triggers. Our objective was to develop an eco-epidemiological modeling approach to characterize the spatial relationships between areas of higher than expected ALS incidence and lake water quality risk factors derived from satellite remote sensing as a surrogate marker of exposure. Our eco-epidemiological modeling approach began with implementing a spatial clustering analysis that was informed by local indicators of spatial autocorrelation to identify locations of normalized excess ALS counts at the census tract level across northern New England. Next, water quality data for all lakes over 6 hectares (n = 4,453) were generated using Landsat TM band ratio regression techniques calibrated with in situ lake sampling. Derived lake water quality risk maps included chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), Secchi depth (SD), and total nitrogen (TN). Finally, a spatially-aware logistic regression modeling approach was executed characterizing relationships between the derived lake water quality metrics and ALS hot spots. Several distinct ALS hot spots were identified across the region. Remotely sensed lake water quality indicators were successfully derived; adjusted R2 values ranged between 0.62-0.88 for these indicators based on out-of-sample validation. Map products derived from these indicators represent the first wall-to-wall metrics of lake water quality across the region. Logistic regression modeling of ALS case membership in localized hot spots across the region, i.e., census tracts with higher than expected ALS counts, showed the following: increasing average SD within a radius of 30 km corresponds with a decrease in the odds of belonging to an ALS hot spot by 59{\%}; increasing average TN within a radius of 30 km and average Chl-a concentration within a radius of 10 km correspond with increased odds of belonging to an ALS hot spot by 167{\%} and 4{\%}, respectively. The strengths of satellite remote sensing information can help overcome traditional field limitations and spatiotemporal data gaps to provide the public health community valuable exposure data.

Given the high spatial and temporal variability of cyanobacterial blooms, remote sensing is more suitable than conventional field surveys in monitoring blooms. However, the majority of existing algorithms cannot distinguish cyanobacterial blooms from eukaryotic algal blooms by extracting spectral features in the remote-sensing reflectance (Rrs). In this study, in situ Rrsspectra of cyanobacterial and green algal blooms in Lakes Gaoyang, Hanfeng and Changshou of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) in China were recorded. Characteristic spectral indices, namely, the normalised difference peak-valley index and Cyano-Chlorophyta index, were used to develop an algorithm that can effectively distinguish cyanobacterial and green algal blooms. The proposed algorithm was also used to investigate the spatio–temporal dynamics of the two phenotypes of blooms derived from Huan Jing 1 charge-coupled device images. The resulting accuracy of 93.5{\%} demonstrated that remote sensing technology, in conjunction with field observation, could efficiently differentiate bloom-forming species and assess the water quality in the TGR.},

Despite considerable efforts to divert effluents from the watershed, the cyanobacterial blooms still reoccur and persist throughout summer. To mitigate cyanobacterial bloom pollution risk, a large scale integrated monitoring and forecasting system was developed, and a series of emergency response measures were instigated based on early warning. This system has been in place for 2009-2012. With this integrated monitoring system, it was found that the detectable maximum and average cyanobacterial bloom area were similar to that before drinking water crisis, indicating that poor eutrophic status and cyanobacterial bloom had persisted without significant alleviation. It also revealed that cyanobacterial bloom would occur after the intense storm, which may be associated with the increase in buoyance of cyanobacterial colonies. Although the cyanobacterial blooms had persisted during the monitoring period, there had been a reduction in frequency and intensity of the cyanobacterial bloom induced black water agglomerates (a phenomenon of algal bloom death decay to release a large amount black dissolved organic matter), and there have been no further drinking water crises. This monitoring and response strategy can reduce the cyanobacterial bloom pollution risk, but cannot reduce eutrophication and cyanobacterial blooms, problems which will take decades to resolve.},

Fundamental elements in this quality assurance framework are sensor radiometric calibration and atmospheric correction models, which are briefly discussed in the paper. In order to evaluate the accuracy of present operational techniques to retrieve basic parameters from satellite data, such as water-leaving radiance and reflectance, an experiment was organised in the frame of SAtellite remote sensing for Lake MONitoring (SALMON), a European Union co-funded research project. A series of ship-based radiometric and atmospheric measuring campaigns were conducted on Lake Iseo and Lake Garda (Italy) together with limnological sampling. Four Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) scenes were acquired during different seasons and simultaneous in situ measurements were made. After the radiometric calibration procedure, satellite digital images were processed by applying two entirely image-based atmospheric correction models. These models account for the effects of both additive scattering and multiplicative transmittance effects in the atmosphere on the at-satellite measured signal. The results achieved using these procedures were evaluated by comparing satellite-based estimates with in situ measurements of water reflectance. The root mean square difference between Landsat TM-derived reflectance values and ground measurements was close to 0.010 reflectance for each TM spectral band. Such image-based correction models, requiring no in situ field measurements during the satellite overpass, constitute a valid method of lake water monitoring.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 by the Ecological Society of America. Understanding how and why lakes vary and respond to different drivers through time and space is needed to understand, predict, and manage freshwater quality in an era of rapidly changing land use and climate. Water clarity regulates many characteristics of aquatic ecosystems and is responsive to watershed features, making it a sentinel of environmental change. However, whether precipitation alters the relative importance of features that influence lake water clarity or the spatial scales at which they operate is unknown. We used a data set of thousands of northern temperate lakes and asked (1) How does water clarity differ between a very wet vs. dry year? (2) Does the relative importance of different watershed features, or the spatial extent at which they are measured, vary between wet and dry years? (3) What lake and watershed characteristics regulate long-term water clarity trends? Among lakes, water clarity was reduced and less variable in the wet year than in the dry year; furthermore, water clarity was reduced much more in high-clarity lakes during the wet year than in low-clarity lakes. Climate, land use/land cover, and lake morphometry explained most variance in clarity among lakes in both years, but the spatial scales at which some features were important differed between the dry and wet years. Watershed percent agriculture was most important in the dry year, whereas riparian zone percent agriculture (around each lake and upstream features) was most important in the wet year. Between 1991 and 2012, water clarity declined in 23{\%} of lakes and increased in only 6{\%} of lakes. Conductance influenced the direction of temporal trend (clarity declined in lakes with low conductance), whereas the proportion of watershed wetlands, catchment-to-lake-area ratio, and lake maximum depth interacted with ante cedent precipitation. Many predictors of water clarity, such as lake depth and landscape position, are features that cannot be readily managed. Given trends of increasing precipitation, eliminating riparian zone agriculture or keeping it  {\textless} 10{\%} of area may be an effective option to maintain or improve water clarity.},

abstract = {Recent deployments of CubeSat imagers by companies such as Planet may advance hydrological remote sensing by providing an unprecedented combination of high temporal and high spatial resolution imagery at the global scale. With approximately 170 CubeSats orbiting at full operational capacity, the Planet CubeSat constellation currently offers an average revisit time of {\textless}1 day for the Arctic and near-daily revisit time globally at 3 m spatial resolution. Such data have numerous potential applications for water resource monitoring, hydrologic modeling and hydrologic research. Here we evaluate Planet CubeSat imaging capabilities and potential scientific utility for surface water studies in the Yukon Flats, a large sub-Arctic wetland in north central Alaska. We find that surface water areas delineated from Planet imagery have a normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) of {\textless}11{\%} and geolocation accuracy of {\textless}10 m as compared with manual delineations from high resolution (0.3–0.5 m) WorldView-2/3 panchromatic satellite imagery. For a 625 km2 subarea of the Yukon Flats, our time series analysis reveals that roughly one quarter of 268 lakes analyzed responded to changes in Yukon River discharge over the period 23 June–1 October 2016, one half steadily contracted, and one quarter remained unchanged. The spatial pattern of observed lake changes is heterogeneous. While connections to Yukon River control the hydrologically connected lakes, the behavior of other lakes is complex, likely driven by a combination of intricate flow paths, underlying geology and permafrost. Limitations of Planet CubeSat imagery include a lack of an automated cloud mask, geolocation inaccuracies, and inconsistent radiometric calibration across multiple platforms. Although these challenges must be addressed before Planet CubeSat imagery can achieve its full potential for large-scale hydrologic research, we conclude that CubeSat imagery offers a powerful new tool for the study and monitoring of dynamic surface water bodies.},

abstract = {The analytical development and underlying hypothesis of a three-band algorithm for estimating chlorophyll-a concentration ([Chla]) in turbid productive waters are presented. The sensitivity of the algorithm to the spectral location of the bands used is analyzed. A large set of experimental observations ([Chla] varied between 4 and 217 mg m(-3) and turbidity between 2 and 78 nephelometric turbidity units) was used to calibrate and validate the algorithm. It was found that the variability of the chlorophyll-a fluorescence quantum yield and of the chlorophyll-a specific absorption coefficient can reduce considerably the accuracy of remote predictions of [Chla]. Instead of parameterizing these interferences, their effects were minimized by tuning the spectral regions used in the algorithm. This allowed us to predict [Chla] with a relative root-mean-square error of less than 30{\%}.},

abstract = {The development and validation of an atmospheric correction algorithm designed for the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) with special emphasis on case?2 waters is described. The algorithm is based on inverse modelling of radiative transfer (RT) calculations using artificial neural network (ANN) techniques. The presented correction scheme is implemented as a direct inversion of spectral top?of?atmosphere (TOA) radiances into spectral remote sensing reflectances at the bottom?of?atmosphere (BOA), with additional output of the aerosol optical thickness (AOT) at four wavelengths for validation purposes. The inversion algorithm was applied to 13 MERIS Level1b data tracks of 2002?2003, covering the optically complex waters of the North and Baltic Sea region. A validation of the retrieved AOTs was performed with coincident in situ automatic sun?sky scanning radiometer measurements of the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) from Helgoland Island located in the German Bight. The accuracy of the derived reflectances was validated with concurrent ship?borne reflectance measurements of the SIMBADA hand?held field radiometer. Compared to the MERIS Level2 standard reflectance product generated by the processor versions 3.55, 4.06 and 6.3, the results of the proposed algorithm show a significant improvement in accuracy, especially in the blue part of the spectrum, where the MERIS Level2 reflectances result in errors up to 122{\%} compared to only 19{\%} with the proposed algorithm. The overall mean errors within the spectral range of 412.5?708.75 nm are calculated to be 46.2{\%} and 18.9{\%} for the MERIS Level2 product and the presented algorithm, respectively.},

abstract = {We propose a normalized difference chlorophyll index (NDCI) to predict chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentration from remote sensing data in estuarine and coastal turbid productive (case 2) waters. NDCI calibration and validation results derived from simulated and MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) datasets show its potential application to widely varying water types and geographic regions. A quadratic function (R2=0.95, p{\textless}0.0001) accurately explained the variance in the simulated data for a chl-a range of 1-60mgm-3. Similarly a twofold calibration and validation of chl-a models using MERIS dataset, (chl-a range: 0.9-28.1mgm-3) yielded R2of 0.9, and RMSE of {\~{}}2mgm-3respectively. NDCI was applied on images over the Chesapeake Bay and Delaware Bay, the Mobile Bay, and the Mississippi River delta region in the northern Gulf of Mexico. The newly developed algorithm was successful in predicting chl-a concentration with approximately 12{\%} overall bias for all above study regions. Findings from this research imply that NDCI can be successfully used on MERIS images to quantitatively monitor chl-a in inland coastal and estuarine waters. In case of remote coastal waters with no ground truth data, NDCI can be used to detect algal bloom and qualitatively infer chl-a concentration ranges very similar to NDVI's application in terrestrial vegetation studies. {\textcopyright} 2011.},

abstract = {Suspended solids and siltation are among the most prevalent problems in streams and rivers of the world; however, because they are often associated with other stresses such as increased nutrient concentrations or changes in channel form, their impacts on the biota and on ecosystem functioning are not fully understood. To assess the effects of pulse sediment deposition on periphyton, we applied an exponential gradient of clay concentration (from 0 to 54.7 g L- 1) for three days to eleven artificial indoor channels precolonized by algae (three controls + eight treatments). This resulted in a gradient of inorganic particulate matter in the bottom from two to over 200 g m- 2. Periphytic biomass, photosynthetic activity and algal communities were studied during the following four weeks. High sediment loads ({\textgreater} 6 g L- 1) initially reduced algal growth but by the end of the experiment periphytic biomass was similar in all channels. Under high sediment load, algal photosynthetic efficiency showed a quick decrease after three days of exposure, followed by a delayed increase in chlorophyll a contents. After two weeks signs of adaptation were observed, first as an increase in photosynthetic efficiency and then as an increase in pigment concentration. Siltation led to changes in community structure; diatoms increased in high silt treatments although green algae still dominated. Overall, the accumulation of fine sediment affected periphytic biomass, photosynthetic activity and community composition. Periphyton adaptation reduced the initial impact, reaching almost full compensation in terms of chlorophyll a and photosynthetic activity; however, algal community composition did not recover within the time frame of this study. Thus, the frequent siltation pulses observed in many streams throughout the world may have an important impact on the periphyton, which would in turn affect stream ecosystem structure and functioning. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

With nearly 40. years of continuous observation - since launch of the first satellite in 1972 - the Landsat program has benefited from insightful technical specification, robust engineering, and the necessary infrastructure for data archive and dissemination. Chiefly, the spatial and spectral resolutions have proven of broad utility and have remained largely stable over the life of the program. The foresighted acquisition and maintenance of a global image archive has proven to be of unmatched value, providing a window into the past and fueling the monitoring and modeling of global land cover and ecological change. In this paper we discuss the evolution of the Landsat program as a global monitoring mission, highlighting in particular the recent change to an open (free) data policy. The new data policy is revolutionizing the use of Landsat data, spurring the creation of robust standard products and new science and applications approaches. Open data access also promotes increased international collaboration to meet the Earth observing needs of the 21st century. {\textcopyright} 2012.},

abstract = {Remote sensing has the potential to provide truly synoptic views of water quality, in particular, the spatial distributions of phytoplankton. Whilst the spectral capabilities of satellites used in ocean colour work have improved significantly over recent years, the application of satellite remote sensing to lake water is constrained by the need for high spatial resolution image data and thus remains limited by spectral resolution capabilities. This becomes a significant problem when attempting to quantify chlorophyll a (Chl a) in waters characterized by high and heterogeneous suspended sediment concentrations (SSC). The SSC dominates the spectral reflectance, masking the spectral influence from other components in broad spectral band systems, making Chl a determination from remote sensing imagery difficult. This paper presents a linear mixture modelling approach to derive accurate estimates of Chl a from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery. This approach was tested in Lake Balaton, Europe's largest shallow lake characterized by high suspended sediment and, until recently, frequent eutrophic and hypereutrophic episodes. The last significant bloom occurred in September of 2000 and a Landsat TM image was acquired for 11th September, during which ground reference data of water quality was collected. The modelled image?derived results of Chl a demonstrate an excellent correspondence (r2 = 0.95) between the ground?based measurements of Chl a, and yield considerable detail of lake phytoplankton distributions. The September 2000 calibration was then successfully applied to a July 1994 Landsat TM image and validated with Chl a data collected coincidently within two days of the image. The comparability between water sample data and image results demonstrates that there is temporal stability and robustness in the approach and calibration described. Remote sensing has the potential to provide truly synoptic views of water quality, in particular, the spatial distributions of phytoplankton. Whilst the spectral capabilities of satellites used in ocean colour work have improved significantly over recent years, the application of satellite remote sensing to lake water is constrained by the need for high spatial resolution image data and thus remains limited by spectral resolution capabilities.

We use new data sources, enhanced spatial resolution, and new analytical approaches to provide new estimates of the global abundance of surface-water bodies. A global model based on the Pareto distribution shows that the global extent of natural lakes is twice as large as previously known (304 million lakes; 4.2 million km 2 in area) and is dominated in area by millions of water bodies smaller than 1 km 2 . Similar analyses of impoundments based on inventories of large, engineered dams show that impounded waters cover approximately 0.26 million km 2 . However, construction of low-tech farm impoundments is estimated to be between 0.1{\%} and 6{\%} of farm area worldwide, dependent upon precipitation, and represents .77,000 km 2 globally, at present. Overall, about 4.6 million km 2 of the earth's continental ‘‘land'' surface (.3{\%}) is covered by water.

abstract = {While there is a general sense that lakes can act as sentinels of climate change, their efficacy has not been thoroughly analyzed. We identified the key response variables within a lake that act as indicators of the effects of climate change on both the lake and the catchment. These variables reflect a wide range of physical, chemical, and biological responses to climate. However, the efficacy of the different indicators is affected by regional response to climate change, characteristics of the catchment, and lake mixing regimes. Thus, particular indicators or combinations of indicators are more effective for different lake types and geographic regions. The extraction of climate signals can be further complicated by the influence of other environmental changes, such as eutrophication or acidification, and the equivalent reverse phenomena, in addition to other land-use influences. In many cases, however, confounding factors can be addressed through analytical tools such as detrending or filtering. Lakes are effective sentinels for climate change because they are sensitive to climate, respond rapidly to change, and integrate information about changes in the catchment.},

abstract = {Suspended Solids Concentration (SSC) in water is related to its quality and transparency. Satellite remote sensing has proven to be an efficient means of monitoring water quality in large deltas because in situ sampling methods are costly, laborious, time consuming, and spatially constrained. In this study, the potential of Landsat's Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) sensor was explored to develop a model for remote sensing-based quantification of SSC within the large, turbid Indus Delta Region (IDR, south of Pakistan). Six scenes were atmospherically corrected using the Dark Object Subtraction (DOS) method, to formulate a model for monitoring water quality of the IDR. An empirical model was developed and validated using in situ SSC measurements (9.4–761.4 mg/L) from several data collection campaigns coinciding (within an 11-day window) with satellite overpasses. It was found that using Band 1 (blue: 450–520 nm), Band 2 (green: 520–600 nm), Band 3 (red: 630–690 nm), and Band 5 (shortwave infrared: 1550–1750 nm) of Landsat-7 ETM + along with the Normalized Difference Suspended Sediment Index (NDSSI) can help in precise and accurate estimation of SSC, resulting in a relatively small Root Mean Square Error of 67.24 mg/L, Mean Absolute Error of 54.75 mg/L, and coefficient of determination of 0.88. Further, it was also evident that residuals do not increase with an increasing time window (0–11 days) between the satellite overpass and in situ data collection. Therefore, the established algorithm can potentially be used for frequent (after 8 days) synoptic mapping of SSC in the IDR and other similar estuarine environments.},

abstract = {1. We examined the absorption of solar radiation by phytoplankton and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) taking into account riparian shading in the rivers, reservoirs, swamps of the Neuse River Estuary and its drainage basin.2. In the streams, CDOM typically absorbed 55 and 64{\%} of photons in the spectral range of 400–700 nm (photosynthetically active radiation, PAR) and 500–600 nm, respectively. The large proportion of photons absorbed by CDOM indicates high potential for abiotic photochemial reactions in the 500–600 nm region.3. Despite the high concentration of nutrients, phytoplankton contributed little (2{\%}) to the total absorption of PAR in the streams. Small ({\textless}30 m wide) streams typically received only 7{\%} of incident PAR that impinged onto the more exposed reservoirs and estuary. Riparian shading and the low contribution of phytoplankton to the total absorption resulted in conditions where phytoplankton absorbed nearly two orders of magnitude less PAR in the streams than in the estuary and reservoirs.4. The results indicated that riparian shading and non-algal absorbing components can significantly restrict phytoplankton production in nutrient-rich streams with a high concentration of CDOM flowing throughout forested catchments.},

Comparing CQ ratios at a given discharge on the rising and falling limbs of the discharge hydrograph provides a consistent, reliable method for categorizing C–Q relations. Five common classes of such relations are single-valued (straight or curved), clockwise loop, counterclockwise loop, single-valued plus a loop, and figure eight. Temporal-graph mode and skewness influence the type of relation, whereas temporal-graph spread affects the details of the particular C–Q relation (its graphical breadth, shape, orientation, and plotted location). Field examples of the various types of relations are given, including varieties that heretofore have received little attention, such as the figure eight. Explanations for each type of C–Q relation are discussed.},

abstract = {The amounts of solar energy and materials are two of the chief factors determining ecosystem structure and process. Here, we examine the relative balance of light and phosphorus in a set of freshwater pelagic ecosystems. We calculated a ratio of light: phosphorus by putting mixed-layer mean light in the numerator and total P concentration in the denominator. This light: phosphorus ratio was a good predictor of the C:P ratio of particulate matter (seston), with a positive correlation demonstrated between these two ratios. We argue that the balance between light and nutrients controls "nutrient use efficiency" at the base of the food web in lakes. Thus, when light energy is high relative to nutrient availability, the base of the food web is carbon rich and phosphorus poor. In the opposite case, where light is relatively less available compared to nutrients, the base of the food web is relatively P rich. The significance of this relationship lies in the fact that the composition of sestonic material is known to influence a large number of ecosystem processes such as secondary production, nutrient cycling, and (we hypothesize) the relative strength of microbial versus grazing processes. Using the central result of increased C:P ratio with an increased light: phosphorus ratio, we make specific predictions of how ecosystem structure and process should vary with light and nutrient balance. Among these predictions, we suggest that lake ecosystems with low light: phosphorus ratios should have several trophic levels simultaneously carbon or energy limited, while ecosystems with high light: phosphorus ratios should have several trophic levels simultaneously limited by phosphorus. Our results provide an alternative perspective to the question of what determines nutrient use efficiency in ecosystems.},

In this paper, the general ACIX framework is discussed; special mention is made of the motivation to initiate the experiment, the inter-comparison protocol, and the principal results. ACIX is free and open and every developer was welcome to participate. Eventually, 12 participants applied their approaches to various Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 image datasets acquired over sites around the world. The current results diverge depending on the sensors, products, and sites, indicating their strengths and weaknesses. Indeed, this first implementation of processor inter-comparison was proven to be a good lesson for the developers to learn the advantages and limitations of their approaches. Various algorithm improvements are expected, if not already implemented, and the enhanced performances are yet to be assessed in future ACIX experiments.},

abstract = {The potential of Landsat data processing to provide systematic continental scale products has been demonstrated by several projects including the NASA Web-enabled Landsat Data (WELD) project. The recent free availability of Landsat data increases the need for robust and efficient atmospheric correction algorithms applicable to large volume Landsat data sets. This paper compares the accuracy of two Landsat atmospheric correction methods: a MODIS-based method and the Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS) method. Both methods are based on the 6SV radiative transfer code but have different atmospheric characterization approaches. The MODIS-based method uses the MODIS Terra derived dynamic aerosol type, aerosol optical thickness, and water vapor to atmospherically correct ETM+ acquisitions in each coincident orbit. The LEDAPS method uses aerosol characterizations derived independently from each Landsat acquisition and assumes a fixed continental aerosol type and uses ancillary water vapor. Validation results are presented comparing ETM+ atmospherically corrected data generated using these two methods with AERONET corrected ETM+ data for 95 10km×10km 30m subsets, a total of nearly 8 million 30m pixels, located across the conterminous United States. The results indicate that the MODIS-based method has better accuracy than the LEDAPS method for the ETM+ red and longer wavelength bands.},

Atmospheric correction is one of the most important steps in this process, which is usually undertaken using atmospheric radiative transfer models. The main difficulty in these models is the need of atmospheric input data which are not usually available. An alternative approach to atmospheric correction is proposed in this Letter. It is based on the idea that the atmospheric effects over two or more dates can be determined in a relative way, by using the apparent reflectance values of surfaces whose ground reflectance can be considered unchangeable with time. This method has been applied to correct Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper images and satisfactory results have been obtained in comparison with those obtained by a traditional model.},

abstract = {Water is an essential resource for life on Earth and available freshwater resources are emerging as a limiting factor not only in quantity but also in quality for human development and ecological stability in a growing number of locations. Water quality is a significant criterion in matching water demand and supply. Securing adequate freshwater quality for both human and ecological needs is thus an important aspect of integrated environmental management and sustainable development. The 2008 Environmental Performance Index (EPI) published by the Yale Center for Environmental Law and Policy (YCELP) and the Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN) at Columbia University includes a Water Quality Index (WATQI). The WATQI provides a first global effort at reporting and estimating water quality on the basis of five commonly reported quality parameters: dissolved oxygen, electrical conductivity, pH value, and total nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations. This paper explains the motivation and methodology of the EPI WATQI and demonstrates how hot-deck imputation of missing values can expand its geographical coverage and better inform decision-makers on the types and extents of water quality problems in the context of limited globally comparable water quality monitoring data.},

abstract = {Monitoring of progress towards the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) drinking water target relies on classification of water sources as “improved” or “unimproved” as an indicator for water safety. We adjust the current Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) estimate by accounting for microbial water quality and sanitary risk using the only-nationally representative water quality data currently available, that from the WHO and UNICEF “Rapid Assessment of Drinking Water Quality”. A principal components analysis (PCA) of national environmental and development indicators was used to create models that predicted, for most countries, the proportions of piped and of other-improved water supplies that are faecally contaminated; and of these sources, the proportions that lack basic sanitary protection against contamination. We estimate that 1.8 billion people (28{\%} of the global population) used unsafe water in 2010. The 2010 JMP estimate is that 783 million people (11{\%}) use unimproved sources. Our estimates revise the 1990 baseline from 23{\%} to 37{\%}, and the target from 12{\%} to 18{\%}, resulting in a shortfall of 10{\%} of the global population towards the MDG target in 2010. In contrast, using the indicator “use of an improved source” suggests that the MDG target for drinking-water has already been achieved. We estimate that an additional 1.2 billion (18{\%}) use water from sources or systems with significant sanitary risks. While our estimate is imprecise, the magnitude of the estimate and the health and development implications suggest that greater attention is needed to better understand and manage drinking water safety.},

We developed a model for the Roanoke River floodplain (United States) to simulate flood extent and duration based on a power law correlation between inundation area A, as mapped from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery, and river discharge Q. Model fit was 0.955 for the upper portion of the study area and 0.789 for the tidally influenced lower section. We then compared hydroperiod simulated for predam (1912-1949) and postdam (1965-1995) periods. Topographically wet areas are now flooded longer than before damming, and dry areas are now drier. Similarly, hydrologically wet years experience longer floods, whereas the driest years are drier. Most importantly, spring hydroperiod regimes are now wetter than prior to damming. Our results suggest that the intermediate zone of the hydrologic gradient has been squeezed to either wetter or drier conditions. The model presented represents a simple but effective empirical method to simulate hydroperiod regimes at the landscape scale in large lowland systems where the data necessary to develop more complex physical models are not available.},

abstract = {The 10-year archive of MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) data is an invaluable resource for studies on lake system dynamics at regional and global scales. MERIS data are no longer actively acquired but their capacity for global scale monitoring of lakes from satellites will soon be re-established through the forthcoming Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI). The development and validation of in-water algorithms for the accurate retrieval of biogeochemical parameters is thus of key importance if the potential of MERIS and OLCI data is to be fully exploited for lake monitoring. This study presents the first extensive validation of algorithms for chlorophyll-a (chl-a) retrieval by MERIS in the highly turbid and productive waters of Lake Balaton, Hungary. Six algorithms for chl-a retrieval from MERIS over optically complex Case 2 waters, including band-difference and neural network architectures, were compared using the MERIS archive for 2007-2012. The algorithms were locally-tuned and validated using in situ chl-a data (n=289) spanning the five year processed image time series and from all four lake basins. In general, both band-difference algorithms tested (Fluorescence Line Height (FLH) and Maximum Chlorophyll Index (MCI)) performed well, whereas the neural network processors were generally found to much less accurately retrieve in situ chl-a concentrations. The Level 1b FLH algorithm performed best overall in terms of chl-a retrieval (R2=0.87; RMSE=4.19mgm-3; relative RMSE=30.75{\%}) and particularly at chl-a concentrations of ≥10mgm-3 (R2=0.85; RMSE=4.81mgm-3; relative RMSE=20.77{\%}). However, under mesotrophic conditions (i.e., chl-a{\textless}10mgm-3) FLH was outperformed by the locally-tuned FUB/WeW processor (relative FLH RMSE{\textless}10mgm-3=57.57{\%} versus relative FUB/WeW RMSE{\textless}10mgm-3=46.96{\%}). An ensemble selection of in-water algorithms is demonstrated to improve chl-a retrievals.},

abstract = {Four dates of Landsat Thematic Mapper data from 1993, April 9, July 30, August 15, and September 16, were used to assess temporal and spatial patterns of lake area and dimensions of suspended sediment concentration in Tuttle Creek Reservoir, Kansas. In 1993, excessive precipitation in the Big Blue River Basin, and throughout much of the Upper Middle West, led to widespread flooding. Rains produced substantial erosion, sediment movement down the stream network, and a runoff volume that filled Tuttle Creek Reservoir, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers flood control structure. The April 9 data are from before the flood, the July 30 data are from the time of maximum pool size and use of the emergency spillway, and the August and September data document the declining pool sizes. Three separate analyses were performed on each of the four dates of Thematic Mapper data. One set of analyses involved applying an existing physical model that uses at-satellite reflectance for TM Band 3 to estimate variations in suspended sediment, turbidity, and Secchi depth throughout the reservoir. Maps of estimated parameters of water quality for the four individual dates were compared and analyzed to document spatial and temporal changes. The second research method involved unsupervised classification (ERDAS ISODATA algorithm) of the data from the Tuttle Creek Reservoir. Water areas were grouped into coherent classes for further spatial analysis using a two-step or layered classification procedure for each date. The third analysis used a GIS overlay technique to compare the area of the water surface for each of the four dates with the flood pool as marked on U.S.G.S. 7-1/2 minute quadrangles. Comparisons document the major change in lake area between April and July, the high levels of suspended sediment in mid-summer, and the decline in pool size and concentrations of suspended sediment by mid-September. The study illustrates the advantages of using remote sensing to assist in documenting a relatively short-term environmental hazard. This study also demonstrates the value of Landsat Thematic Mapper data for use in mapping geographic variations in water area and quality in conjunction with a major flood event.},

abstract = {We provide results of quantitative measurements and characterization for inland freshwater Lake Taihu from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the satellite Aqua. China. 's Lake Taihu, which is located in the Yangtze River delta in one of the world. 's most urbanized and heavily populated areas, contains consistently highly turbid waters in addition to frequent large seasonal algae blooms in various lake regions. Thus, satellite data processing requires use of the shortwave infrared (SWIR) atmospheric correction algorithm. Specifically for Lake Taihu, an iterative SWIR-based atmospheric correction algorithm has been developed and proven to provide reasonably accurate water-leaving radiance spectra data. Using MODIS-Aqua measurements, the blue-green algae bloom in Lake Taihu in 2007 has been studied in detail, demonstrating the importance and usefulness of satellite water color remote sensing for effectively monitoring and managing a bloom event.Seasonal and interannual variability, as well as spatial distributions, of lake water properties were studied and assessed using the MODIS-Aqua measurements from 2002 to 2008. Results show that overall waters in Lake Taihu are consistently highly turbid all year round, with the winter and summer as the most and least turbid seasons in the lake, respectively. Extremely turbid waters in the winter are primarily attributed to strong winter winds that lead to significant amounts of total suspended sediment (TSS) in the water column. In addition, MODIS-Aqua-measured water-leaving radiance at the blue band is consistently low in various bay regions in Lake Taihu, indicating high algae concentration in these regions. Climatological water property maps, including normalized water-leaving radiance spectra nLw(-), chlorophyll-a concentration, and water diffuse attenuation coefficient at the wavelength of 490nm (Kd(490)), are derived from all MODIS-Aqua data from 2002 to 2008 for Lake Taihu, showing overall spatial distribution features for the lake water property. {\textcopyright} 2010.},

abstract = {Coastal subsidence causes sea-level rise, shoreline erosion and wetland loss, which poses a threat to coastal populations. This is especially evident in the Mississippi Delta in the southern United States, which was devastated by Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The loss of protective wetlands is considered a critical factor in the extensive flood damage. The causes of subsidence in coastal Louisiana, attributed to factors as diverse as shallow compaction and deep crustal processes, remain controversial. Current estimates of subsidence rates vary by several orders of magnitude. Here, we use a series of radiocarbon-dated sediment cores from the Mississippi Delta to analyse late Holocene deposits and assess compaction rates. We find that millennial-scale compaction rates primarily associated with peat can reach 5mm per year, values that exceed recent model predictions. Locally and on timescales of decades to centuries, rates are likely to be 10mm or more per year. We conclude that compaction of Holocene strata contributes significantly to the exceptionally high rates of relative sea-level rise and coastal wetland loss in the Mississippi Delta, and is likely to cause subsidence in other organic-rich and often densely populated coastal plains.},

abstract = {Rivers are the main source of sediment to the marine environment in global terms. This sediment is predominantly suspended sediments. Calculation of suspended sediment flux requires the combination of suspended sediment concentration and water discharge records. A continuous record of suspended sediment concentration is derived for Land Ocean Interaction Study (LOIS) river monitoring sites using an innovative dual turbidity sensor system. Calibration of turbidity data, to provide a record of suspended sediment concentration, is achieved by comparisons with bulk water/sediment samples collected from Humber rivers, covering the full turbidity range usually encountered in British rivers. The equipment, methodologies and preliminary results are described, along with the potential errors and limitations. One of the functions of remote sensed data is to help understand the applicability of such point measurements. LOIS is using such data, acquired by imaging spectrometers mounted in an aircraft, to map the spatial distribution of suspended sediment concentration. A semi-empirical relationship has been developed between suspended sediment concentrations and the irradiance reflectance recorded in a near infra red band by the compact airborne spectral imager (CASI). The resulting data on the spatial distribution of suspended sediment concentration are illustrated by an example from the lower part of the River Ouse, Yorkshire. The next stage of the programme will integrate the field science and remote sensing studies with other LOIS rivers research on properties, river bank erosion and sediment source studies.},

abstract = {Water clarity in North America's Laurentian Great Lakes has undergone considerable change over the last several decades as a consequence of invasive species, eutrophication, and implemented nutrient management practices. Satellite observations from the CZCS, SeaWiFS, and MODIS-Aqua sensors have been used in tandem with long term records of Secchi disk depth (Z SD) to provide a retrospective analysis of spatial and temporal variations in water clarity over the Great Lakes. A simple empirical algorithm is presented, relating Z SD to remote-sensing reflectance at 550 nm (R rs550). Results suggest remarkable and complex changes in water clarity over the Great Lakes. Lakes Ontario, Huron, and Michigan have seen increases in average Z SD over the three sensor periods of 58{\%}, 49{\%}, and 62{\%}, respectively. Lake Erie shows highly variable Z SD with no consist-ent long term trends, while Lake Superior has remained fairly consistent in its lake-wide water clarity condi-tions. Temporal trends document the decrease in whiting events on Lake Michigan while capturing the ongoing occurrence of these seasonal bright-water events on Lake Ontario. Results indicate a divergence in Z SD trends between nearshore and offshore environments; with larger increases in offshore than nearshore Z SD and some nearshore areas suggesting a decrease in Z SD . Offshore regions of Lakes Huron, Michigan, and Superior show diminished Z SD seasonality in contrast to increasing seasonal variance in the nearshore. Spatial and temporal variations in Z SD are in agreement with documented reductions in Great Lakes bioproductivity, degrading nearshore water quality, and changing biogeochemical processes influencing whiting events and sediment resuspension. Inland freshwater systems are increasingly recognized as playing an important role in global biogeochemical cycling and serve as sentinels of anthropogenic influence on aquatic environments. North America's Laurentian Great Lakes (Fig. 1) are the largest system of surface freshwater on earth, but with over 33 million people living in the region and almost a third of all Canadian and U.S. agricultural production (Environ-ment Canada 2010) they have experienced significant water quality pressures over the years. The Great Lakes contribute considerably to the region's economy both through commer-cial fishing and tourism and provide water for municipal, agri-cultural, and industrial uses (Environment Canada 2001), so the sustainable use and management of this water resource is a complex issue.},
annote = {Relevant Chunks/Citations:
Attenuation coeffi- cients have been previously estimated empirically from blue- to-green reflectance ratios (Mueller 2000) but this approach performs poorly in optically complex waters where the opti- cally active constituents may not co-vary (Doron et al. 2007). Empirical algorithms for Landsat based on a wide range of band combinations have been used successfully to map Secchi depths for inland waters (Chipman et al. 2004; Olmanson et al. 2008; McCullough et al. 2012),

Several studies have demonstrated strong correlations between ZSD and single band reflectance (Budd et al. 2001; Binding et al. 2007; McCullough et al. 2012).

The visual range of the human eye in water has a peak at approximately 550 nm, so a clarity measure based
on Rrs?550 may be in broad agreement with that observed by the naked eye in a Secchi disk depth (ZSD) measurement
(Davies-Colley et al. 1993).

Imagery may docu- ment seasonal and inter-annual variability of scattering events driven by organic or inorganic suspended particles, capturing recurring biogeochemical lake processes such as phytoplankton blooms, re-suspension of bottom sediments, nearshore erosion events, and whiting events.

abstract = {The growth of mass populations of toxin-producing cyanobacteria is a serious concern for the ecological status of inland waterbodies and for human and animal health. In this study we examined the performance of four semi-analytical algorithms for the retrieval of chlorophyll a (Chl a) and phycocyanin (C-PC) from data acquired by the Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager-2 (CASI-2) and the Airborne Imaging Spectrometer for Applications (AISA) Eagle sensor. The retrieval accuracies of the semi-analytical models were compared to those returned by optimally calibrated empirical band-ratio algorithms. The best-performing algorithm for the retrieval of Chl a was an empirical band-ratio model based on a quadratic function of the ratio of reflectance at 710 and 670nm (R2=0.832; RMSE=29.8{\%}). However, this model only provided a marginally better retrieval than the best semi-analytical algorithm. The best-performing model for the retrieval of C-PC was a semi-analytical nested band-ratio model (R2=0.984; RMSE=3.98mgm-3). The concentrations of C-PC retrieved using the semi-analytical model were correlated with cyanobacterial cell numbers (R2=0.380) and the particulate and total (particulate plus dissolved) pools of microcystins (R2=0.858 and 0.896 respectively). Importantly, both the empirical and semi-analytical algorithms were able to retrieve the concentration of C-PC at cyanobacterial cell concentrations below current warning thresholds for cyanobacteria in waterbodies. This demonstrates the potential of remote sensing to contribute to early-warning detection and monitoring of cyanobacterial blooms for human health protection at regional and global scales. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Monitoring and understanding the physical, chemical and biological status of global inland waters are immensely important to scientists and policy makers alike. Whereas conventional monitoring approaches tend to be limited in terms of spatial coverage and temporal frequency, remote sensing has the potential to provide an invaluable complementary source of data at local to global scales. Furthermore, as sensors, methodologies, data availability and the network of researchers and engaged stakeholders in this field develop, increasingly widespread use of remote sensing for operational monitoring of inland waters can be envisaged. This special issue on Remote Sensing of Inland Waters comprises 16 articles on freshwater ecosystems around the world ranging from lakes and reservoirs to river systems using optical data from a range of in situ instruments as well as airborne and satellite platforms. The papers variably focus on the retrieval of in-water optical and biogeochemical parameters as well as information on the biophysical properties of shoreline and benthic vegetation. Methodological advances include refined approaches to adjacency correction, inversion-based retrieval models and in situ inherent optical property measurements in highly turbid waters. Remote sensing data are used to evaluate models and theories of environmental drivers of change in a number of different aquatic ecosystems. The range of contributions to the special issue highlights not only the sophistication of methods and the diversity of applications currently being developed, but also the growing international community active in this field. In this introductory paper we briefly highlight the progress that the community has made over recent decades as well as the challenges that remain. It is argued that the operational use of remote sensing for inland water monitoring is a realistic ambition if we can continue to build on these recent achievements.},

Here we show Pan-Arctic characteristics of CDOM light absorption for various Arctic regions covering both coastal and oceanic waters during the Tara Oceans Polar Circle expedition. The Siberian (or eastern) side of the AO is characterized by higher CDOM absorption values compared to the North American (or western) side. This is due to the difference in watersheds between the eastern and western sides of the AO and is consistent with an Arctic absorption database recently built by Matsuoka et al. (2014). A direct comparison between in situ and satellite data demonstrates that CDOM absorption is derived Arctic-wide from satellite ocean color data with an average uncertainty of 12{\%} (root mean square error of 0.3m−1) using our previously published algorithm. For river-influenced coastal waters, we found a single and highly significant relationship between concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and CDOM absorption (r2{\textgreater}0.94) covering major Arctic river mouths. By applying this in situ relationship to satellite-derived CDOM absorption, DOC concentrations in the surface waters are estimated for river-influenced coastal waters with an average uncertainty of 28{\%}. Implications for the monitoring of DOC concentrations in Arctic coastal waters are discussed.},

abstract = {A method of converting the Landsat-MSS radiance to an estimate of suspended sediment concentration is presented in this paper. The CCT data for the Lower Yellow River (Hwang Ho) were used in the study. The data were first corrected for instrumental error due to a drift in the sensor response and then converted to the absolute radiance received by the sensor. In order to understand the detected radiance and its variability, radiative transfer in the earth's atmosphere and natural waters are discussed. The radiative transfer equation has been simplified, so that a highly accurate atmospheric correction algorithm for diffuse sky radiance may be developed. However, the MSS is more sensitive to the direct sky radiance, and so an atmospheric correction based on the normalization of the solar angle is considered. Following a logarithmic relationship between radiance and suspended sediment concentration, the corrected remote-sensing radiance is used to estimate suspended sediment concentrations in the Lower Yellow River. The results suggest that the relationship could represent a universal algorithm for estimating suspended sediment concentration, although further detailed study will be needed to investigate this property. There is also sufficient evidence to indicate that remote sensing radiance may be used to infer the sediment size distribution, which represents a very important parameter in sediment transport studies. Finally, cross sections of suspended sediment concentration at Lijin in the Lower Yellow River are derived from the satellite data, and a map of sediment distribution in the estuary is also presented. ?? 1988.},

abstract = {A method has been developed, based on spectral mixture analysis, to estimate the concentration of suspended sediment in surface waters of the Amazon River wetlands from Landsat {\{}MSS{\}} and {\{}TM{\}} images. Endmembers were derived from laboratory reflectance measurements of water-sediment mixtures with a range of sediment concentrations. Using these reference spectra, we applied a linear mixture analysis to multispectral images after accounting for instrument and atmosphere gains and offsets. Sediment concentrations were estimated for individual pixels from the mixture analysis results based on a nonlinear calibration curve relating laboratory sediment concentrations and reflectance to endmember fractions. The uncertainty in the sediment concentrations derived from this analysis for three Amazon images is predicted to be within ±20 mg/L, and the concentrations fall within a range of concentrations of suspended sediment that were measured at several times and places in the field over the past 15 years. The emphasis of our work is to use the patterns of sediment concentrations to compute the approximate volumes of sediment that are transferred between the main channel and floodplain of the Amazon River. However, the methodology can be applied universally if the optical properties of water and sediment at the site are known, and it is, therefore, useful for the study of suspended sediment concentrations in surface waters of wetlands elsewhere.},

The laboratory experiment reported in this paper investigated these dependences. The reflectance in four wavebands (two visible and two near-infrared) of a large water-filled and wave-free tank were recorded as three variables were changed, namely SSC, sensor viewing angle and relative sensor azimuth. The strength of the positive relationship between reflectance and SSC was shown to vary with (i) wavelength, as the maximum reflectance and SSC class separability occurred at the longer visible wavelengths, and (ii) viewing geometry, as the reflectance/SSC asymptote was dependent upon both the angle and azimuth of the sensor. The optimum conditions for the sensing of SSC were concluded to be nadir in visible (0{\textperiodcentered}55 and 0{\textperiodcentered}65 $\mu$m) and near-infrared (0.75 $\mu$m) wavelengths.},

abstract = {A general algorithm for determining suspended sediment concentrations in the surface waters of estuaries has been developed for use with satellite data. The algorithm uses a three-parameter general optical equation to relate suspended sediment concentrations to water reflectances that have been corrected for sun angle effects, atmospheric path radiance, and tidal excursion. Using data collected by the advanced very high resolution radiometer on five different dates, reflectances were determined using two different methods, one providing maximum correction for haze and the other providing minimum sensitivity to pigments. For both methods, in situ and remotely sensed samples from Delaware Bay acquired within 3.5 hours of each other agreed to within 60{\%} at the 95{\%} confidence level. Pixel and subpixel scale spatial variations and variability associated with in situ measurements produced about 50{\%} of the differences. Chlorophyll concentrations of {\textgreater}50 $\mu$g/L produced a discrepancy in the reflectance method that provided the best haze correction. The parameter values may be adjusted to allow for variations in sediment size and pigment variations, allowing application of the calibration to estuaries having optically different suspended sediments.},

In this study, 5 years (1989-1993)of NOAA Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer satellite data were used toinvestigate the variability of the Mississippi River sediment plume and theenvironmental forcing factors responsible for its variability. Plumevariability was determined by extracting tit formation on plume area andplume length from 112 cloud-free satellite images. Correlation and multipleregression techniques were used to quantify these relationships for possiblepredictive applications. River discharge and wind forcing were identified asthe main factors affecting plume variability. Seasonal and interannualvariabilities in plume area were similar in magnitude and correspondedclosely with large changes in river discharge. However, day-to-dayvariability in plume size and morphology was more closely associated withchanges in the wind field. The plume parameters best predicted by themultiple regression models were plume area, east and west of the delta.Predictive models were improved by separating the data into summer and winterseasons. The best predictive model for the western area was obtained duringsummer when 64{\%} of plume variability was explained by river discharge, windspeed, and the east-west wind component. The best model for the eastern plumearea was obtained during summer when river discharge, the north-south andeast-west triad components explained 70{\%} of plume variability. The best modelfor the offshore extent of the sediment plume was obtained daring summer when53{\%} of plume variability was explained by the east-west wind component, riverdischarge, and triad speed. All plume measurements were maximized by eastwardwinds from slightly different directions. During winter, the area and lengthof the western plume was additionally enhanced by offshore winds associatedwith winter storms. Anticyclonic curvature of the plume west of the delta wasobserved in 42 {\%} of the satellite images. This circulation pattern wasobserved primarily in association with westward winds.},

In many areas of the world, the level of anthropogenic activity is such that fine-grained sediment fluxes have been, or are being, modified at a magnitude and rate that cause profound, and sometimes irreversible, changes in the way that river systems function. This paper examines how anthropogenic activity has caused sig- nificant changes in the quantity and quality of fine-grained sediment within river systems, using examples of: land use change in New Zealand; the effects of reservoir construction and management in different countries; the interaction between sediment dynamics and fish habitats in British Columbia, Canada; and the management of contaminated sediment in USA rivers.

abstract = {Abstract The use of remotely-sensed optical data to estimate the suspended sediment concentration (SSC) of water is dependent upon the correlation between SSC and reflectance. The strength of this relationship was hypothesized to vary with sediment type, as it is known that sediments, when dry, differ in their particle size distributions, colour and therefore reflectance properties. To test this, the reflectance of pure water with four concentrations of white clay and red silt were measured in the laboratory using a spectroradiometer. The correlation between SSC and reflectance varied with wavelength and sediment type. For white clay the correlations were very high (r?0{\textperiodcentered}98) in visible and near-infrared wavelengths but for the red silt it was lower (r?0{\textperiodcentered}8) in blue wavelengths increasing to much higher levels (r?0{\textperiodcentered}98) in blue/green and longer wavelengths. It was concluded that sediment type can affect the strength of the correlation between SSC and reflectance and that this will be most noticeable at shorter wavelengths.},

abstract = {The East China Sea (ECS) is well known for its high concentration of total suspended matter (TSM). Some regions of the ECS have concentrations higher than 5000gm -3, exceeding the valid ranges of many TSM remote sensing algorithms. To overcome the limitation of the existing algorithms, a new TSM model, the "complex proxy TSM model" (CPTSM), is developed in this study. The model is established on the basis of a complex proxy of remote sensing reflectance. The proxy is designed to convert the non-linear relationship between reflectance and TSM to a quasi-linear function over the entire range of TSM concentrations. This proxy is deduced from four indices defined by combinations of the reflectance at different bands. The four indices take advantage of the different relationships between the band combinations of the reflectance and total TSM concentrations. The band selections and model parameters are based on correlation coefficients and regression analysis between the indices and TSM. The results show that the correlation coefficient of 0.912 between the proxy and TSM is higher than that between any individual index and TSM. To validate the CPTSM model, TSM, turbidity, and reflectance data were collected in the ECS during 4 cruises in 2006 and 2007. The actual TSM concentration was measured by weighing the samples collected on filter papers. Turbidity was measured by a Seapoint Turbidity Meter. The turbidity data with values higher than 750FTU were re-calibrated using an empirical equation. All turbidity values were converted to TSM concentrations using a linear equation. The in situ reflectance was measured using the above-water method at 459 stations and the in-water method at 146 stations. A total of 87 pairs of reflectance measured by both methods were used for inter-comparison with a relative difference of 4.5{\%}. The reflectance values were used to retrieve TSM concentrations using the CPTSM model. A comparison with in situ measurements gave a mean relative error of 23{\%}. Applying the CPTSM model to the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) data and analyzing the errors from a match-up dataset of SeaWiFS and in situ data, we found that the average relative error was 24.5{\%}. We propose to use the CPTSM model to map TSM concentrations from satellite data in the ECS. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

MGTR offers reflectance in 11 bands within the spectral range of 0.45 to 0.90 ??m. The reflectance data has been utilised to develop empirical relationships with Secchi depth, turbidity and tannin concentration. The spectral reflectance data does not directly indicate the measure of the COD. However, an empirical relationship between tannin concentration and COD has been established which allows an indirect measurement of the COD. The conventional environmental engineering laboratory approach for determination of the above parameters is time consuming, expensive and slow. This results in serious constraints in monitoring pollution parameters at frequent intervals for a large number of sampling points. The outcome of the study shows the viability of MGTR as a means of quick, repetitive and handy remote sensing for monitoring pollution caused by tanneries in narrow surface streams.},

abstract = {In the Laurentian Great Lakes, the prolific growth of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV, dominated by the filamentous green alga Cladophora) is negatively impacting human and wildlife health, fisheries, and aesthetic conditions. The distribution of Cladophora and similar SAV in the Great Lakes and how that has changed over recent decades has been unknown, and the magnitude of the current problem relative to historic growth is difficult to assess given the lack of field data and monitoring. Here, we present the first comprehensive map of SAV in the nearshore zone of the lower four Great Lakes, where 'nearshore' indicates the zone where the bottom reflectance is sufficient to characterize bottom substrate type, using primarily the visible bands of the Landsat TM sensor. Multiple spectral bands were combined to minimize the water-depth-dependent variance in lake bottom reflectance, and pixels were classified as dense vegetation, sparse vegetation or uncolonized substrate. Changes in vegetation cover and water clarity between the mid-1970s and present were also evaluated for several focus areas across the lakes utilizing historical Landsat TM and MSS imagery. The Landsat-based bottom classification achieved an overall accuracy of 83{\%} based on comparison to ground truth data. Lake-wide SAV cover ranged from 15{\%} (Lake Huron) to 40{\%} (Lake Ontario) of the mappable lake bottom based on detection depth. The total mapped area of vegetation corresponds to a conservative biomass estimate of 129 kilotonnes dry weight. The observed changes in the distribution of SAV over time indicate that increasing water clarity in the Lakes is expanding Cladophora habitat.},

abstract = {Suspended sediments concentration (SSC) in surface water derived from bottom sediment resuspension or discharge of sediment-laden rivers is an important indication of coastal water quality and changes rapidly in high-energy coastal area. Since artificial neural networks (ANN) had been proven successful in modeling a variety of geophysical transfer functions, an ANN model to simulate the relationship between surface water SSC and satellite-received radiances was employed. In situ SSC measurements from the Hangzhou Bay and the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 250 m daily products were adopted in this study. Significant correlations were observed between in situ measurements and band 1-2 reflectance values of MODIS images, respectively. Results indicated that application of ANN model with one hidden layer appeared to yield superior simulation performance (r (2) = 0.98; n = 25) compared with regression analysis method. The RMSE for the ANN model was less than 10{\%}, whereas the RMSE for the regression analysis was more than 25{\%}. Results also showed that different tidal situations affect the model simulation results to some extent. The SSC of surface water in Hangzhou Bay is high and changes rapidly due to tidal flood and ebb during a tidal cycle. The combined utilization of Terra and Aqua MODIS data can capture the tidal cycle induced dynamic of surface water SSC. This study demonstrated that MODIS 250 m daily products and ANN model are useful for monitoring surface SSC dynamic within high-energy coastal water environments.},

The coefficients of the model were fitted on a trial-and-error basis but with reference to known physical conditions. Both a concentration and a wavelength dependence of the optical coefficients were necessary in order to produce the final scattering to absorption ratios. The simulation study also indicated that the maximum upwell-ing wavelength could be a pertinent parameter in helping to identify water masses. The simulated remote sensing algorithms worked equally well with both the Landsat MSS data and with Nimbus-7 CZCS data, the latter taken from two regions, the Bay of Fundy and the Beaufort Sea.

abstract = {Monitoring coastal and inland waters, recognized as case II waters, using the existing Landsat technology is somewhat restricted because of its low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and its rela- tively poor radiometric resolution. The new generation of Landsat, Landsat Data Continuity Mission (LDCM) carrying the Opera- tional Land Imager (OLI), has enhanced features allowing for a more lucid characterization of water constituents in either coastal or inland waters with respect to Landsat-7 (ETM+). This paper applies a physics-based approach to fully examine the potential of OLI in terms of its enhanced features in a water constituent retrieval framework. An EO-1 dataset, including Hyperion and the Advanced Land Imager (ALI), together with nearly coinci- dent ETM+ imagery were atmospherically corrected using a data- driven approach. An in-water radiative transfer model, i.e., Hy- drolight, was applied to generate a Look-Up-Table (LUT) of sim- ulated surface reflectances for various combinations of water con- stituents. Using the Hyperion-derived concentration maps as val- idation sources, it was found that the simulated OLI imagery is superior to ETM+ on the order of 40{\%}, 20{\%}, and 28{\%} when re- trieving the concentrations of chlorophyll-a and total suspended solids (TSS), as well as the absorption of the colored dissolved or- ganic matter (CDOM), respectively. It was also demonstrated that the simulatedOLIimagery outperforms the simulated ALI and the recorded ALI datasets in the retrieval of chlorophyll-a andCDOM absorption. It is concluded that the new generation of Landsat en- ables mapping and monitoring of case II waters with accuracies not achieved with the previous Landsat satellite series.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 American Chemical Society. Mountaintop removal coal mining (MTM) is a form of surface mining where ridges and mountain tops are removed with explosives to access underlying coal seams. The crushed rock material is subsequently deposited in headwater valley fills (VF). We examined how this added water storage potential affects streamflow using a paired watershed approach consisting of two sets of mined and unmined watersheds in West Virginia. The mined watersheds exported 7-11{\%} more water than the reference watersheds, primarily due to higher and more sustained baseflows. The mined watersheds exported only {\~{}}1/3 of their streamflow during storms, while the reference watersheds exported {\~{}}2/3 of their annual water yield during runoff events. Mined watersheds with valley fills appear to store precipitation for considerable periods of time and steadily export this alkaline and saline water even during the dry periods of the year. As a result, MTMVFs in a mixed mined/unmined watershed contributed disproportionately to streamflow during baseflow periods (up to  {\textgreater} 90{\%} of flow). Because MTMVFs have both elevated summer baseflows and continuously high concentrations of total dissolved solids, their regional impact on water quantity and quality will be most extreme and most widespread during low flow periods.},

abstract = {The successful launch of Hyperion in November 2000 bridged the gap between the high-resolution (spatial and spectral) airborne remote sensing and the lower resolution satellite remote sensing. Although designed as a technical demonstration for land applications, Hyperion was tested for its capabilities over a range of water targets in Eastern Australia, including Moreton Bay in southern Queensland. Moreton Bay was the only Australian Earth Observing 1 (EO-1) Hyperion coastal site used for calibration/validation activities. This region was selected due to its spatial gradients in optical depth, water quality, bathymetry, and substrate composition. A combination of turbid and humic river inputs, as well as the open ocean flushing, determines the water quality of the bay. The field campaigns were coincident with Hyperion overpasses, retrieved inherent optical properties, apparent optical properties, substrate reflectance spectra, and water quality parameters. Environmental noise calculations demonstrate that Hyperion has sufficient sensitivity to detect optical water quality concentrations of colored dissolved organic matter, chlorophyll, and suspended matter in the complex waters of Moreton Bay. A methodology was developed integrating atmospheric and hydrooptical radiative transfer models (MODTRAN-4, Hydrolight) to estimate the underwater light field. A matrix inversion method was applied to retrieve concentrations of chlorophyll, colored dissolved organic matter, and suspended matter, which were comparable to those estimated in the field on the days of the overpass.},

abstract = {Glacial Lake McConnell lasted from 11.8 to 8.3 ka BP while occupying parts of the Great Bear, Great Slave and Athabasca Lake basin. The retreating Laurentide ice-front formed the eastern margin, whereas low rolling hills formed the north, west and south shorelines. Three major deltas were deposited at the mouths of the Laird, Peace and Athabasca rivers. The total extent of all phases of the lake was 240,000 km2, while the largest extent was 210,000 km2 at 10.5 ka BP. Downwarping of the basin by glacial ice was the main cause of the lake, whereas sediment blockage between Jean Marie River and Fort Simpson was secondary. Initially, glacial Lake McConnell occupied the northwestern corner (Smith Arm) of the Great Bear Lake basin and discharged through the Hare Indian River outlet. By 11.5 ka BP the enlarged water body flowed out the Great Bear River, but only for a short period of time. The Mackenzie River formed the third outlet near Jean Marie River at 11 ka BP and flow in the Great Bear River ceased until 9 ka BP. At 9.9 ka BP glacial Lake McConnell was impacted by a major flood from glacial Lake Agassiz with a peak discharge of 2-7 ?? 106 m3/sec. Flood water discharged from glacial Lake McConnell, peaking at 0.35-0.57 ?? 106 m3/sec and receding flow continued for 30 months. The massive influx of floodwater into glacial Lake McConnell caused an abrupt increase of discharge, which enlarged the outlet channel to between 6 and 13 km wide between Fort Simpson and Jean Marie River. At 8.3 ka BP, isostatic rebound ended the 3500-year-old extensive lake by dividing it into the Great Slave Lake and Lake Athabasca. ?? 1995.},

@article{Concha2016,
abstract = {New approaches need to be considered to solve the current high demand for color producing agent (CPA) retrievals over inland and coastal waters (Case 2 waters). Traditional retrieval algorithms are known to fail over highly turbid Case 2 waters because they were developed specifically for the open ocean (Case 1 waters). Landsat 8 provides an improved signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and a new spectral coastal aerosol band in the blue. This additional information provides means to tackle this retrieval endeavor. A look-up-table (LUT) and spectrum-matching methodology was implemented to simultaneously retrieve CPAs, taking advantage of Landsat 8's new features. A LUT of spectral remote-sensing reflectances (Rrs) with different concentrations of CPAs was produced using the in-water radiative transfer model HydroLight. A model-based empirical line method (MoB-ELM) algorithm was developed to atmospherically correct the Landsat 8 imagery and allow direct comparison with the LUT of Rrs. This MoB-ELM atmospheric correction algorithm uses pseudo-invariant features (PIFs) from the image, ground-truth data and the HydroLight model. The retrieval algorithm was applied over three Landsat 8 scenes and shows a normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE) of about 14{\%} for chlorophyll-a, 11{\%} for total suspended solids (TSS), and 7{\%} for colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) when compared with ground-truth data. The CPA concentration maps exhibit expected trends of low concentrations in clear water and higher concentrations in turbid water. These results demonstrate that the developed algorithm allows the simultaneous mapping of concentration of all CPAs in Case 2 waters and over areas where the traditional algorithms fail or are not available due to spatial resolution. Therefore, this study shows that the Landsat 8 satellite can be utilized over Case 2 waters as long as a careful atmospheric correction is applied.},

Recently a new program (named Fmask) designed to accomplish these tasks was introduced for use with images from Landsats 4-7 (Zhu {\&} Woodcock, 2012). In this paper, there are the following: (1) improvements in the Fmask algorithm for Landsats 4-7; (2) a new version for use with Landsat 8 that takes advantage of the new cirrus band; and (3) a prototype algorithm for Sentinel 2 images. Though Sentinel 2 images do not have a thermal band to help with cloud detection, the new cirrus band is found to be useful for detecting clouds, especially for thin cirrus clouds. By adding a new cirrus cloud probability and removing the steps that use the thermal band, the Sentinel 2 scenario achieves significantly better results than the Landsats 4-7 scenario for all 7 images tested. For Landsat 8, almost all the Fmask algorithm components are the same as for Landsats 4-7, except a new cirrus cloud probability is calculated using the new cirrus band, which improves detection of thin cirrus clouds. Landsat 8 results are better than the Sentinel 2 scenario, with 6 out of 7 test images showing higher accuracies.},

abstract = {Accurate assessment of phytoplankton chlorophyll a (Chla) concentration in turbid waters by means of remote sensing is challenging due to optically complexity and significant variability of case 2 waters, especially in inland waters with multiple optical types. In this study, a water optical classification algorithm is developed, and two semi-analytical algorithms (three- and four-band algorithm) for estimating Chla are calibrated and validated using four independent datasets collected from Taihu Lake, Chaohu Lake, and Three Gorges Reservoir. The optical classification algorithm is developed using the dataset collected in Taihu Lake from 2006 to 2009. This dataset is also used to calibrate the three- and four-band Chla estimation algorithms. The optical classification technique uses remote sensing reflectance at three bands: Rrs(G), Rrs(650), and Rrs(NIR), where G indicates the location of reflectance peak in the green region (around 560. nm), and NIR is the location of reflectance peak in the near-infrared region (around 700. nm). Optimal reference wavelengths of the three- and four-band algorithm are located through model tuning and accuracy optimization. The three- and four-band algorithm accuracy is further evaluated using other three independent datasets. The improvement of optical classification in Chla estimation is revealed by comparing the performance of the two algorithms for non-classified and classified waters. Using the slopes of the three reflectance bands, the 138 reflectance spectra samples in the calibration dataset are classified into three classes, each with a specific spectral shape character. The three- and four-band algorithm performs well for both non-classified and classified waters in estimating Chla. For non-classified waters, strong relationships are yielded between measured and predicted Chla, but the performance of the two algorithms is not satisfactory in low Chla conditions, especially for samples with Chla below 30mg m-3. For classified waters, the class-specific algorithms perform better than for non-classified waters. Class-specific algorithms reduce considerable mean relative error from algorithms for non-classified waters in Chla predicting. Optical classification makes that there is no need to adjust the optimal position to estimate Chla for other waters using the class-specific algorithms. The findings in this study demonstrate that optical classification can greatly improve the accuracy of Chla estimation in optically complex waters. {\textcopyright} 2010.},

abstract = {The intertidal environments of estuaries represent critical exchange environments of sediment and sediment bound contaminants. Ecological and sedimentological related investigations of these environments require monitoring methods that provide rapid spatially representative data on sediment grain size distribution. Remote sensing has the potential to provide synoptic information of intertidal environments. Previous in situ and laboratory-based reflectance investigations have demonstrated that for effective quantification of sediment grain size distributions, remote sensing platforms must include measurements within the short-wave infrared (SWIR). In addition, the timing of image acquisition, in relation to tidal cycles and sediment moisture content, is critical in optimising the spectral differences between the coarser sand and finer 'mud' fraction of sediments. Daedalus 1268 Airborne Thematic Mapper (ATM) has been identified as an appropriate platform and sensor for providing accurate synoptic maps of estuarine sediment distributions. This paper presents the results from the application of ATM 1.75 m resolution data to the mapping of surface sediment grain-size distributions across intertidal areas of Ribble Estuary, Lancashire, UK. ATM imagery was acquired after the intertidal area was exposed to strong summer drying conditions. Pre-processing and linear unmixing of the imagery collected of the intertidal zone following a period of drying allowed accurate sub-pixel determinations (1.75 m resolution) of sediment clay (r2=0.79) but less accurate for sand (r2=0.60). The results also demonstrate deterioration in the image calibration with increasing sediment moisture content and microphytobenthos cover. However, recombining the subpixel end member abundances through multivariate regression analysis improved the image calibration significantly for both sediment clay and sand content (r2{\textgreater}0.8) for imagery collected in both dryer and wetter conditions. These results demonstrate that ATM data, or similar, can be used to gain quantitative information on intertidal sediment distributions and such data has application to a wide variety of estuarine research. ?? 2003 Elsevier Inc.

A white aluminum panel placed at the bottom of the tank was used as the bright bottom, and a flat-black tank liner served as the dark bottom. Sixteen levels of suspended sediment from 25 to 400 mg/L were used in each experiment. Spectral data were collected using a Spectron SE-590 spectro-radiometer. The major findings include the following: the bright bottom had the greatest impact at visible wavelengths; when suspended sediment concentrations exceeded 100 mg/L, the bright bottom response was found to be negligible; and, substrate brightness has aminimal impact between 740 and 900 nm, suggesting that these wavelengths are best for measuring suspended sediment concentrations by means of remote sensing.},

abstract = {The first issue of WRR appeared eight years after the launch of Sputnik, but by WRR's 25th anniversary, only seven papers that used remote sensing had appeared. Over the journal's second 25 years, that changed remarkably, and remote sensing is now widely used in hydrology and other geophysical sciences. We attribute this evolution to production of data sets that scientists not well versed in remote sensing can use, and to educational initiatives like NASA's Earth System Science Fellowship program that has supported over a thousand scientists, many in hydrology. We review progress in remote sensing in hydrology from a water balance perspective. We argue that progress is primarily attributable to a creative use of existing and past satellite sensors to estimate such variables as evapotranspiration rates or water storage in lakes and reservoirs and to new and planned missions. Recent transforming technologies include the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), the European Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and U.S. Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) missions, and the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission. Future missions include Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) to measure river discharge and lake, reservoir, and wetland storage. Measurement of some important hydrologic variables remains problematic: retrieval of snow water equivalent (SWE) from space remains elusive especially in mountain areas, even though snow cover extent is well observed, and was the topic of 4 of the first 5 remote sensing papers published in WRR. We argue that this area deserves more strategic thinking from the hydrology community.},

@article{Syvitski2003,
abstract = {It has become increasingly difficult to assess the impact of changes in the sediment flux to the coastal zone because of the conflicting impacts of humans. Globally, soil erosion is accelerating (e.g., deforestation, some agriculture practices), while at the same time sediment flux to the coastal zone is globally decelerating (e.g., water diversion schemes, dams). Reduced loads delivered to the coastal zone result in an accelerated coastal erosion and a decrease in habitat. The reduction of the seasonal flood waves also means that sediment is dispersed over smaller areas of the continental margin. One of the great challenges facing hydrologists, with regard to our understanding of anthropogenic versus climate-change impacts on the hydrological cycle, is the quality and duration coverage of hydrological data, particularly on pristine rivers. For many rivers, the length of hydrological coverage is measured in years rather than decades, with no rivers with reliable observations across centuries. In other words, if a river's discharge is monitored during periods where the impacts of humans or nature produce a long-term trend, then the return-interval concept for floods and droughts, for instance, becomes meaningless. In addition, river systems are conditioned by events that are largely prehistorical. Forensic studies of paleoriver systems provide us with some ability to assess and discern the impacts of humans versus climate. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

A controlled experiment was conducted outdoors in a 7510-litre wafer tank using natural sunlight. A red loam soil was added and suspended in the tank filled with clear and algae-laden waters, respectively. A total of 20 levels of SSC (from 25 to 500 mg l(-1)) were created for each type of treatment. Reflectance was recorded using an ASD spectroradiometer, and the bi-directional reflectance factor was computed and analyzed. The same amount of suspended sediment generated higher reflectance between 400 and 700 nm in clear water than in algae-laden water due to the blue and red absorption of chlorophyll. The effect of chlorophyll on the SSC-reflectance relationship was minimum at wavelengths between 700 and 900 nm. For both clear and algae-laden wafers, the linearity in the SSC-reflectance relationship increased with wavelength between 400 and 900 nm. A near-linear relationship between SSC and reflectance was found between 720 and 900 nm.},

abstract = {We provide a comprehensive overview of water constituent retrieval algorithms and underlying definitions and models for optically deep and complex (i.e. case 2) waters using earth observation data. The performance of constituent retrieval algorithms is assessed based on matchup validation experiments published between January 2006 and May 2011. Validation practices range from singular vicarious calibration experiments to comparisons using extensive in situ time series. Band arithmetic and spectral inversion algorithms for all water types are classified using a method based scheme that supports the interpretation of algorithm validity ranges. Based on these ranges we discuss groups of similar algorithms in view of their strengths and weaknesses. Such quantitative literature analysis reveals clear application boundaries. With regard to chlorophyll retrieval, validation of blue-green band ratios in coastal waters is limited to oligotrophic, predominantly ocean waters, while red-NIR ratios apply only at more than 10mg/m 3. Spectral inversion techniques - although not validated to the same extent - are necessary to cover all other conditions. Suspended matter retrieval is the least critical, as long as the wavelengths used in empirical models are increased with concentrations. The retrieval of dissolved organic matter however remains relatively inaccurate and inconsistent, with large differences in the accuracy of comparable methods in similar validation experiments. We conclude that substantial progress has been made in understanding and improving retrieval of constituents in optically deep and complex waters, enabling specific solutions to almost any type of optically complex water. Further validation and intercomparison of spectral inversion procedures are however needed to learn if solutions with a larger validity range are feasible. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

On deltas, the rate of relative eustatic sea-level rise is often smaller than the rate for isostatic-controlled subsidence and of the same order of magnitude as natural sediment compaction. Accelerated compaction associated with petroleum and groundwater mining can exceed natural subsidence rates by an order of magnitude. The reduction in sediment delivery to deltas due to trapping behind dams, along with the human control of routing river discharge across delta plains, contributes to the sinking of world deltas. Consequences include shoreline erosion, threatened mangroves swamps and wetlands, increased salinization of cultivated land, and hundreds of millions of humans put at risk.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}In just the past five years, the field of Earth observation has evolved from the relatively staid approaches of government space agencies into a plethora of sensing opportunities afforded by CubeSats, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), and smartphone technologies that have been embraced by both for-profit companies and individual researchers. Over the previous decades, space agency efforts have brought forth well-known and immensely useful satellites such as the Landsat series and the Gravity Research and Climate Experiment (GRACE) system, with costs typically on the order of one billion dollars per satellite and with concept-to-launch timelines on the order of two decades (for new missions). More recently, the proliferation of smartphones has helped to miniaturise sensors and energy requirements, facilitating advances in the use of CubeSats that can be launched by the dozens, while providing 3{\&}ndash;5{\&}thinsp;m resolution sensing of the Earth on a daily basis. Start-up companies that did not exist five years ago now operate more satellites in orbit than any space agency and at costs that are a mere fraction of an agency mission. With these advances come new space-borne measurements, such as high-definition video for understanding real-time cloud formation, storm development, flood propagation, precipitation tracking, or for constructing digital surfaces using structure-from-motion techniques. Closer to the surface, measurements from small unmanned drones and tethered balloons have mapped snow depths, floods, and estimated evaporation at sub-meter resolution, pushing back on spatiotemporal constraints and delivering new process insights. At ground level, precipitation has been measured using signal attenuation between antennae mounted on cell phone towers, while the proliferation of mobile devices has enabled citizenscience to record photos of environmental conditions, estimate daily average temperatures from battery state, and enable the measurement of other hydrologically important variables such as channel depths using commercially available wireless devices. Global internet access is being pursued via high altitude balloons, solar planes, and hundreds of planned satellite launches, providing a means to exploit the Internet of Things as a new measurement domain. Such global access will enable real-time collection of data from billions of smartphones or from remote research platforms. This future will produce petabytes of data that can only be accessed via cloud storage and will require new analytical approaches to interpret. The extent to which today's hydrologic models can usefully ingest such massive data volumes is not clear. Nor is it clear whether this deluge of data will be usefully exploited, either because the measurements are superfluous, inconsistent, not accurate enough, or simply because we lack the capacity to process and analyse them. What is apparent is that the tools and techniques afforded by this array of novel and game-changing sensing platforms presents our community with a unique opportunity to develop new insights that advance fundamental aspects of the hydrological sciences. To accomplish this will require more than just an application of the technology: in some cases, it will demand a radical rethink on how we utilise and exploit these new observation platforms to enhance our understanding of the Earth system.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The usability of high-resolution satellite imagery for estimating spatial water quality patterns in urban water bodies is evaluated using turbidity in the lower Charles River, Boston as a case study. Water turbidity was surveyed using a boat-mounted optical sensor (YSI) at 5mspatial resolution, resulting in about 4,000 data points. The ground data were collected coincidently with a satellite imagery acquisition (IKONOS), which consists of multispectral (R, G, B) reflectance at 1 m resolution. The original correlation between the rawground and satellite datawas poor (R2= 0.05). Ground data were processed by removing points affected by contamination (e.g., sensor encounters a particle floc), which were identified visually. Also, the ground data were corrected for the memory effect introduced by the sensor's protective casing using an analytical model. Satellite data were processed to remove pixels affected by permanent non-water fea- tures (e.g., shoreline). In addition, water pixels within a certain buffer distance from permanent non-water features were removed due to contamination by the adjacency effect. To determine the appropriate buffer distance, a procedure that explicitly considers the distance of pixels to the permanent non-water features was applied. Two automatic methods for removing the effect of temporary non-water features (e.g., boats)were investigated, including (1) creating a water-only mask based on an unsupervised classification and (2) remov- ing (filling) all local maxima in reflectance. After the various processing steps, the correlation between the ground and satellite data was significantly better (R2= 0.70). The correlation was applied to the satellite image to develop a map of turbidity in the lowerCharlesRiver, which reveals large-scale patterns in water clarity. However, the adjacency effect prevented the application of this method to near-shore areas, where high-resolution patterns were expected (e.g., outfall plumes).},

abstract = {This paper presents a comprehensive review of sediment transport in ice-affected rivers by documenting a range of unique ice and sediment transport processes. In cold regions during winter, high sediment transport rates can occur under specific ice conditions, even if the channel discharge is low. River ice directly displaces and carries sediment, and some ice processes can move boulder-sized sediment, contributing to the sculpting of river channels in ways water alone could not. Special attention is directed to the ice breakup period, during which most dynamic ice processes take place and when sediment supply to river channels is maximized. Also discussed are the time and space scales over which ice processes affect sediment transport. Moreover, a global framework that describes the interconnectivity of climate, river discharge, channel morphology, in-stream hydraulics, and sediment transport response is proposed. Within this framework, ice processes are given a central function, as they influence and are affected by sediment transport, hydrological conditions, and channel morphology. A segment of this work reviews and explores the interconnectivity between river ice processes and river discharge as well as between river ice processes and channel morphology. The proposed framework represents a practical tool for a wide range of cold region river scientists and engineers, particularly in light of climate change. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Current monitoring efforts are limited in scope due to resource limitations, analytical complexity, and data integration efforts. The goals of this study were to validate an algorithm for satellite imagery that could potentially be used to monitor surface cyanobacteria events in near real-time to provide a compressive monitoring capability for freshwater lakes ({\textgreater}. 100. ha). The algorithm incorporated narrow spectral bands specific to the European Space Agency's (ESA's) MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) instrument that were optimally oriented at phytoplankton pigment absorption features including phycocyanin at 620. nm. A validation of derived cyanobacteria cell counts was performed using available in situ data assembled from existing monitoring programs across eight states in the eastern US over a 39-month period (2009-2012). Results indicated that MERIS provided robust estimates for low (10,000-109,000 cells/mL) and very high ({\textgreater}. 1,000,000 cells/mL) cell enumeration ranges (approximately 90{\%} and 83{\%}, respectively). However, the results for two intermediate ranges (110,000-299,000 and 300,000-1,000,000 cells/mL) were substandard, at approximately 28{\%} and 40{\%}, respectively. The confusion associated with intermediate cyanobacteria cell count ranges was largely attributed to the lack of available taxonomic data and distinction of natural counting units for the in situ measurements that would have facilitated conversions between cell counts and cell volumes. The results of this study document the potential for using MERIS-derived cyanobacteria cell count estimates to monitor freshwater lakes ({\textgreater}. 100. ha) across the eastern US.},

abstract = {Remote sensing was used to understand the seasonal and spatial variation of suspended sediment in the Ganges and Brahmaputra Rivers in Bangladesh for two different discharge periods. Suspended sediment concentration (SSC) in these rivers was estimated from the reflectance of Landsat TM band 3. During the high discharge period, SSC in the Ganges is higher than that in the Brahmaputra. But in the low discharge period, this is reversed. Both erosional and depositional processes are active on their flood plains. Significant fluctuations in SSC and in suspended sediment load were observed along their courses because of river bank erosion and deposition and/or scouring and aggradation of river beds. Owing to scouring and turbulence, SSC increases markedly at the confluence of these rivers. Reflectance of AVHRR band 1 data was also analysed to study the distribution of suspended sediment along other reaches of these rivers. Like SSC, reflectance at the confluence zone increases compared with that in the Brahmaputra. However, this increase is not marked compared with the Ganges. The influence of their tributaries on the suspended sediment load could be inferred from the pattern of reflectance. Remote sensing data used in this study was corrected for atmospheric effects.},

abstract = {This study evaluates currently available imagery from Landsat, MERIS, MODIS, and AWiFS sensors for their usefulness in regional-scale measurements of lake water clarity and chlorophyll for comprehensive lake management and scientific studies (e.g., modeling). Images from these systems were collected nearly concurrently and processed using methods similar to those developed previously for regional assessments of lake water clarity using Landsat imagery. We tested both atmospherically corrected and uncorrected imagery products; the uncorrected products performed as well as or better than the atmospherically corrected products in empirical relationships to estimate water clarity and chlorophyll. MODIS and MERIS systems, which have large swath widths and high temporal coverage are well suited for regional assessments of large lakes, but their low spatial resolution limits the number of lakes that can be assessed. Landsat imagery allows all lakes 4 ha (more than 12,000 in Minnesota) to be assessed, but its low spectral resolution limits assessments to water clarity. The MERIS system, with spectral and spatial resolution suitable for large 150 ha) lakes, was the only system with a spectral band set that measured key absorption and scattering characteristics of phytoplankton that could be used reliably for regional chlorophyll assessments. Although none of the currently available systems is ideal, the study yielded a better definition of the spectral, spatial, and temporal characteristics of the ideal system for regional-scale water quality remote sensing that may be realized in upcoming satellite systems.},

abstract = {The Kolyma River basin in northeastern Siberia, the sixth largest river basin draining to the Arctic Ocean, contains vast reserves of carbon in Pleistocene!aged permafrost soils. Permafrost degradation, as a result of climate change, may cause shifts in riverine biogeochemistry as this old source of organic matter is exposed. Satellite remote sensing offers an opportunity to complement and extrapolate field sampling of dissolved organic matter in this expansive and remote region. We develop empirically based algorithms that estimate chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the Kolyma River and its major tributaries in the vicinity of Cherskiy, Russia. Field samples from July 2008 and 2009 were regressed against spectral data from the Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper and Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper!Plus. A combination of Landsat band 3 and bands 2:1 resulted in an R2 of 0.78 between measured CDOM and satellite!derived predictions. Owing to the strong correlation between CDOM and DOC, the resulting maps of the region show strong interannual variability of both CDOM and DOC, and important spatial patterns such as mixing zones at river confluences and downstream loading of DOC. Such variability was previously unobserved through field!based point observations and suggests that current calculations of DOC flux from the Kolyma River to the Arctic Ocean may be underestimates. In this era of rapid climate change, permafrost degradation, and shifts in river discharge, remote sensing of CDOM and DOC offers a powerful, reliable tool to enhance our understanding of carbon cycling in major arctic river systems.

@article{Jay2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier Inc. Hyperspectral remote sensing is now an established tool to determine shallow water properties over large areas, usually by inverting a semi-analytical model of water reflectance. However, various sources of error may make the observed subsurface remote-sensing reflectance deviate from the model, resulting in an increased retrieval error when inverting the model based on classical least-squares fitting. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic forward model of shallow water reflectance variability that describes two of the main sources of error, namely, (1) the environmental noise that includes every source of above-water variability (e.g., sensor noise and rough water surface), and (2) the potentially complex inherent spectral variability of each benthic class through their associated spectral covariance matrix. Based on this probabilistic model, we derive two inversion approaches, namely, MILE (MaxImum Likelihood estimation including Environmental noise) and MILEBI (MaxImum Likelihood estimation including Environmental noise and Bottom Intra-class variability) that utilize the information contained in the proposed covariance matrices to further constrain the inversion while allowing the observation to differ from the model in the less reliable wavebands. In this paper, MILE and MILEBI are compared with the widely used least-squares (LS) criterion in terms of depth, water clarity and benthic cover retrievals. For these three approaches, we also assess the influence of constraining bottom mixture coefficients to sum to one on estimation results. The results show that the proposed probabilistic model is a valuable tool to investigate the influence of bottom intra-class variability on subsurface reflectance, e.g., as a function of optical depth or environmental noise. As expected, this influence is critical in very optically shallow waters, and decreases with increasing optical depth. The inversion results obtained from synthetic and airborne data of Quiberon Peninsula, France, show that MILE and MILEBI generally provide better performances than LS. For example, in the case of airborne data with depth ranging from 0.44 to 12.00 m, the bathymetry estimation error decreases by about 32{\%} when using MILE and MILEBI instead of LS. Estimated maps of bottom cover are also more consistent when derived using sum-to-one constrained versions of MILE and MILEBI. MILE is shown to be a simple but powerful method to map simple benthic habitats with negligible influence of intra-class variability. Alternatively, MILEBI is to be preferred if this variability cannot be neglected, since taking bottom covariance matrices into account concurrently with mean reflectance spectra may help the bottom discrimination, e.g., in the presence of overlapping classes. This study thus shows that taking potential sources of error into account through appropriate parameterizations of spectral covariance may be critical to improve the remote sensing of shallow waters, hence making MILE and MILEBI interesting alternatives to LS.},

abstract = {We present results of mercury (Hg) in surface waters and soils and an analysis of satellite imagery from the Tapaj??s River basin, Brazilian Amazon, and the Reserva Garimpeira do Tapaj??s, the legal gold mining district of the basin. Hg bound to suspended sediment was roughly 600 and 200 times the concentration of dissolved Hg per litre of water, in impacted and pristine areas, respectively. Suspended sediments thus represent the major pathway of river-borne Hg. Median concentrations of Hg in suspended load from both impacted and pristine waters were 134 ppb, and 80{\%} of samples were below 300 ppb-in the range of naturally occurring surficial materials in the tropics. Regionally, riverine Hg fluxes were proportional to the concentration of total suspended solids. This shows that the dominant source of Hg is the sediment itself rather than anthropogenic mercury discharge from the small-scale mines. To independently test this conclusion, a mass balance was performed. A conservative calculation of the annual export of mercury (Hg) from the Crepor?? River (a minimum) was 1.6 tonnes for the year 1998-it could be significantly larger. This amount of Hg is difficult to account for by anthropogenic discharge alone, confirming that enhanced physical erosion caused by sluicing and dredging operations is the dominant source of Hg. We therefore conclude that gold mining operations are primarily responsible for elevated Hg concentrations. The dominant source of contamination is not, however, the loss of Hg in the gold amalgamation process. Rather, the disturbance and mobilization of large quantities of Hg-rich sediment and floodplain soil into the water column during mining operations is the source of contamination. These findings shift the focus of remediation and prevention efforts away from Hg control toward soil and sediment erosion control. The minimization or elimination of Hg losses in the mining process remains important for the health of local peoples and environments, but keeping basin soils and sediments in place would be a much more effective means of minimizing Hg fluxes to the region's rivers. To gain a spatial and historical perspective on the source and extent of emissions, satellite imagery was used. We were able to reconstruct historical mining activity, locate impacted areas, and estimate historical Hg fluxes with the imagery. To do so, the spectral characteristics of satellite images were calibrated to the concentration of suspended sediment in the rivers, which, in turn, is proportional to the Hg concentration. This analysis shows that mining-induced sediment plumes have been a dominant source of sediment to the Tapaj??s River system for decades. As well, the intensity and location of these emissions has varied through time. For example, sediment discharge from the Crepor?? River was greater in 1985 than in 1998; and the tributaries on the west bank of the Tapaj??s were actively being mined in 1985 but had been abandoned in 1998. This type of information should greatly assist in understanding original and ongoing sources of emissions, and in managing prevention and remediation efforts. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The transport of fine sediment, carried in suspension by water, is central to the hydrology, geomorphology, and ecological functioning of river floodplains and deltas. An extensive new field data set for the Peace-Athabasca Delta (PAD), Canada quantifies robust positive relationships between in situ suspended sediment concentration (SSC) and remotely sensed visible/near-infrared reflectance. These relationships are exploited using SPOT and ASTER satellite images to map suspended sediment concentrations across the PAD for four days in 2006 and 2007, revealing strong variations in water sources and flow patterns, including flow reversals in major distributaries. Near-daily monitoring with 276 MODIS satellite images tracks hydrologic recharge of floodplain lakes, as revealed by episodic infusions of sediment-rich water from the Athabasca River. The timing and magnitude of lake recharge are linked to springtime water level on the Athabasca River, suggesting a system sensitive to changes in river flow regime. Moreover, recharge timing differentiates lakes that are frequently and extensively recharged from those recharged more rarely. Finally, we present a first estimation of river flow velocity based on remotely sensed SSC, though saturation may occur at velocities {\textgreater}0.6 m/s. Viewed collectively, the different remote sensing methodologies presented here suggest strong value for visible/near-infrared remote sensing of suspended sediment to assess hydrologic and sediment transport processes in complex flow environments.

abstract = {New and previously unimaginable Landsat applications have been fostered by a policy change in 2008 that made analysis-ready Landsat data free and open access. Since 1972, Landsat has been collecting images of the Earth, with the early years of the program constrained by onboard satellite and ground systems, as well as limitations across the range of required computing, networking, and storage capabilities. Rather than robust on-satellite storage for transmission via high bandwidth downlink to a centralized storage and distribution facility as with Landsat-8, a network of receiving stations, one operated by the U.S. government, the other operated by a community of International Cooperators (ICs), were utilized. ICs paid a fee for the right to receive and distribute Landsat data and over time, more Landsat data was held outside the archive of the United State Geological Survey (USGS) than was held inside, much of it unique. Recognizing the critical value of these data, the USGS began a Landsat Global Archive Consolidation (LGAC) initiative in 2010 to bring these data into a single, universally accessible, centralized global archive, housed at the Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. The primary LGAC goals are to inventory the data held by ICs, acquire the data, and ingest and apply standard ground station processing to generate an L1T analysis-ready product. As of January 1, 2015 there were 5,532,454 images in the USGS archive. LGAC has contributed approximately 3.2 million of those images, more than doubling the original USGS archive holdings. Moreover, an additional 2.3 million images have been identified to date through the LGAC initiative and are in the process of being added to the archive. The impact of LGAC is significant and, in terms of images in the collection, analogous to that of having had two additional Landsat-5 missions. As a result of LGAC, there are regions of the globe that now have markedly improved Landsat data coverage, resulting in an enhanced capacity for mapping, monitoring change, and capturing historic conditions. Although future missions can be planned and implemented, the past cannot be revisited, underscoring the value and enhanced significance of historical Landsat data and the LGAC initiative. The aim of this paper is to report the current status of the global USGS Landsat archive, document the existing and anticipated contributions of LGAC to the archive, and characterize the current acquisitions of Landsat-7 and Landsat-8. Landsat-8 is adding data to the archive at an unprecedented rate as nearly all terrestrial images are now collected. We also offer key lessons learned so far from the LGAC initiative, plus insights regarding other critical elements of the Landsat program looking forward, such as acquisition, continuity, temporal revisit, and the importance of continuing to operationalize the Landsat program.},

Simple band ratio algorithms, band tuning methods, semi-empirical algorithms, and the modified Gaussian model (MGM) parameters were used to estimate CHL and PC from multiple source spectral datasets of two eutrophic central Indiana reservoirs: Eagle Creek and Morse. The spectral datasets were collected over a three-year period (2005 to 2007) using two field-based (ASD Field-Spec; Ocean Optics USB4000) spectroradiometers Spectral parameters used in these mapping algorithms were examined for their correlation to the CHL and PC concentrations. The results demonstrate for estimating CHL, simple and modified band ratios performed well; for PC estimation, the highest performing models include the algorithms using MGM strength and band tuning methodology. ? 2012 American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.},

The aim of our study was to investigate whether it is feasible to estimate different lake carbon fractions (CDOM, DOC, TOC, DIC, TIC and pCO2) from space using sensors like OLCI on future Sentinel 3. In situ measurements were carried out in eight measuring stations in two Swedish lakes within 2days of MERIS overpass. The results suggest that the MERIS CDOM product was not suitable for estimating CDOM in lakes M{\"{a}}laren and T{\"{a}}mnaren and was not a good proxy for mapping lake DOC and TOC from space. However, a simple green to red band ratio and some other MERIS products like the total absorption coefficient, turbidity index, suspended matter and chlorophyll-a were correlated with different carbon fractions and could potentially be used as proxies to map these lake carbon fractions (CDOM, DOC, TOC, DIC, TIC and pCO2) from space.},

abstract = {Remotely sensed data can be used to estimate successfully the concentration of sediment in water. Such estimation has relied on relationships between suspended sediment concentration (SSC) and radiation in one or two broad wavebands where it is assumed that the effects of environmental variability (irradiance, subpixel cloud, etc.) are either small, or can be considered as spectrally additive constants in all wavebands. Where these assumptions do not hold, an alternative and theoretically more robust relationship is proposed, t that between SSC and derivative radiation (change in radiation per unit wavelength). Measurements of spectral reflectance (R$\lambda$), derivative spectral reflectance (DR$\lambda$) and SSC were measured in the laboratory, where the effects of environmental variability were small and at sea where the effects of environmental variability were large. There was a strong correlation between SSC and DR$\lambda$ both in the laboratory (max R2 = − 0.98) and at sea (max R2 = − 0.83) and DR$\lambda$ was used to estimate SSC in the laboratory to an error of less than 8 {\%} of the mean SSC. The correlation between R$\lambda$ and SSC was weaker at sea (max R2 = 0.46) than in the laboratory (max R2 = 0.96). This was due to the presence of large and spectrally variable environmental effects. We recommend the use of derivative spectra for the estimation of SSC when continuous spectra are available.},

abstract = {1. The fashion for examining riverine landscapes is changing as our technical instruments, from microprobes to satellites, expands to be able to examine the spatial and temporal relationships among biota, hydrology and geomorphology across scales from microhabitats to channel units to valleys to catchments. 2. The range of successful applications from remote sensing analyses of riverine landscapes has especially increased with the launch of many new instruments that record data across the electromagnetic spectrum. Engineering of the instruments has also improved such that knowledge of the radiometric properties of the digital data is more complete as a result of better instrumentation and installation of on-board calibrations systems for many instruments. 3. With the development of faster processing on cheaper computers, it is now common for comprehensive data sets to be processed through algorithms that previously could only be applied to relatively small ({\textless}1 Mbyte) rasters of data. This technical advance is especially important for the statistical algorithms such as principal components and spectral mixture analysis that can decompose gradients in the spectral data. The combined effect is the production of regional views of riverine landscapes separated into components of water, vegetation and soil. 4. The landscape properties of riverine landscapes that have been most successfully measured with remote sensing data include community and habitat level classification and connectivity of waterbodies with optical and radar data. Laser and radar altimetric data measured from aircraft provide land elevations at resolutions as fine as decimetres. A remaining challenge is to achieve an exact match between the categories of landscape classification from the remote sensing analysis and data from field surveys or model outputs. 5. In contrast to many landscape properties, several water properties are now routinely measured as absolute values (water surface elevation, temperature, surface sediment concentration and algal concentration) with remote sensing. New analyses of both passive and active radar data in addition have led to measurements of inundation and wetness that are providing valuable insight into the dynamics of flooding and its effect on riverine landscapes. 6. Finally, an effective examination of the variability in landscape cover includes additional analyses of remote sensing products using pattern metrics that measure the scale of patchiness and distribution of the landscape properties. These types of variability measures at the regional scale contribute to an increased understanding of the way in which spatial heterogeneity of riverine landscapes varies across scales and how landscape filters (sensu Poff, 1997) influence the evolution of these diversity patterns.},

abstract = {Continental aquatic systems from rivers to the coastal zone are considered within two perspectives: (i) as a major link between the atmosphere, pedosphere, biosphere and oceans within the Earth system with its Holocene dynamics, and (ii) as water and aquatic biota resources progressively used and transformed by humans. Human pressures have now reached a state where the continental aquatic systems can no longer be considered as being controlled by only Earth system processes, thus defining a new era, the Anthropocene. Riverine changes, now observed at the global scale, are described through a first set of syndromes (flood regulation, fragmentation, sediment imbalance, neo-arheism, salinization, chemical contamination, acidification, eutrophication and microbial contamination) with their related causes and symptoms. These syndromes have direct influences on water uses, either positive or negative. They also modify some Earth system key functions such as sediment, water, nutrient and carbon balances, greenhouse gas emissions and aquatic biodiversity. Evolution of river syndromes over the past 2000 years is complex: it depends upon the stages of regional human development and on natural conditions, as illustrated here for the chemical contamination syndrome. River damming, eutrophication and generalized decrease of river flow due to irrigation are some of the other global features of river changes. Future management of river systems should also consider these long-term impacts on the Earth system.},

abstract = {Recent advances in communication and sensor technology have catalyzed progress in remote monitoring capabilities for water quality. As a result, the ability to characterize dynamic hydrologic properties at adequate temporal and spatial scales has greatly improved. These advances have led to improved statistical and mechanistic modeling in monitoring of water quality trends at local, watershed and regional scales for freshwater, estuarine and marine ecosystems. In addition, they have greatly enhanced rapid (e.g., real-time) detection of hydrologic variability, recognized as a critical need for early warning systems and rapid response to harmful algal bloom events. Here, we present some of the landmark developments and technological achievements that led to the advent of real-time remote monitors for hydrologic properties. We conclude that increased use and continuing advancements of real-time remote monitoring (RTRM) and sensing technologies will become a progressively more important tool for evaluating water quality. Recent engineering and deployment of RTRM technologies by federal and state regulatory agencies, industries, and academic laboratories is now permitting rapid detection of, and responses to, environmental threats imposed by increased nutrient loadings, development of hypoxic and anoxic areas, toxicants, and harmful algal bloom outbreaks leading to fish kill events and potential human health impacts.},

abstract = {Satellite remote sensing can be considered a suitable approach to monitor the extent of cyanobacterial blooms compared with conventional ship surveys because of the patchiness and high spatial and temporal variability of the blooms. However, most of the existing algorithms are not capable of distinguishing cyanobacterial blooms and aquatic macrophytes due to their similar spectral characteristics in the red and near infrared (NIR) wavelengths. In this study, we conducted in situ spectral measurements and satellite data analyses for cyanobacterial blooms and aquatic macrophytes to find an effective method to distinguish them using medium-resolution Landsat satellite images. The reflectance spectra were measured for lake waters and cyanobacterial blooms with 13 different chlorophyll-a concentration levels (from 54 to 21,736$\mu$gL-1) and four types of aquatic macrophytes (two emerged and two floating-leaved macrophytes) in the wavelength range from 350 to 2500nm. In addition, seven Landsat images were collected for nine lakes in Japan or Indonesia. We calculated several selected indices, i.e., the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), five types of normalized difference water index (NDWI), and the floating algal index (FAI) to find an appropriate index for distinguishing cyanobacterial blooms and aquatic macrophytes.The results showed that the spectral characteristics of cyanobacterial blooms were significantly different from those of aquatic macrophytes in the short-wave infrared (SWIR) region, indicating that the SWIR bands are important for distinguishing cyanobacterial blooms and aquatic macrophytes. The results also showed that the combination of FAI and NDWI4,5 was an effective method for classifying lake areas. We first used the FAI for extracting lake waters, and we then used the NDWI4,5 to classify the remaining areas as cyanobacterial blooms or aquatic macrophytes. The results also showed that the threshold of NDWI4,5 was less sensitive to the effects of both the atmosphere and mixed pixels compared to the other indices. Our application of the FAI threshold of 0.05 and the NDWI4,5 threshold of 0.63 to six lakes in Japan and Indonesia showed that the proposed method could successfully distinguish lake water, cyanobacterial blooms, and aquatic macrophytes.},

Fort Lauderdale (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. Previous geologic research on Holocene Mississippi River deltaic deposits has verified that the present delta plain and associated nearshore barrier islands and submarine shoals are either direct or indirect products of cyclic delta-building events that have operated on a variety of temporal and spatial scales. A major depositional element of the modern delta plain is the delta complex, of which there are six: (1) Maringouin, (2) Teche, (3) St. Bernard, (4) Lafourche, (5) Balize, and (6) Atchafalaya. Major delta-building events have occurred at a frequency of one every 1-2 kyr. Deposits associated with the six major delta complexes are fundamental constructional units of the delta plain, which collec-tively covers an area of -30,000 km2. Sedimentary deposits associated with these delta-building events range in thickness from about 10 to 100 m. Their construction is modulated by stream capture, which develops a new delta complex by way of a new river course. Delta complexes may be comprised of one or more delta lobes. As a product of this delta switching, the depositional architecture of the delta plain consists of laterally offset and stacked delta lobes. Within delta lobes are subdeltas and even smaller crevasse-splays. These smaller scale deltas sedimentologically and geomorphically mimic their larger delta lobe counterparts, but they are considerably thinner, cover less area, and have a shorter period of development and abandonment. Subdeltas are usually {\textless} 10 m thick and may fill shallow bays that cover over 300 km2. They build and deteriorate on time-scales of 150-200 years. Crevasse-splays or overbank splays are {\textless} 5 m thick, cover only a few square kilometers, and are abandoned after several decades of active growth. Each delta evolves through a rapid regressional phase as water and sediment are captured from an antecedent river course. If highstand conditions persist long enough, deltas may prograde to the outer shelf to form wedges of deltaic sediment much thicker than their inner shelf counterparts. The delta-building process starts with the filling of interior lakes (lacustrine deltas), which is followed by bayhead delta-building at the coast, and finally by progra-dation across the marine shelf (shelf delta). Delta complexes and delta lobes, as well as their smaller counterparts, experience three phases of growth and abandonment: (1) rapid growth with increasing-to-stable discharge, (2) relative stability during initial stages of waning discharge, when sediment input balances the collective effects of subsidence, and (3) abandonment, followed by rapid subsidence-driven subaerial delta deterioration. In the rapid growth stage, formerly eroding-subsiding coastal environments experience delta plain accretion and coastal progradation from re-newed sediment input. On the abandonment side of the cycle, marine processes overwhelm fluvial processes and rework the delta perimeter. Forced by the combined processes of subsidence, the delta surface undergoes progressive submergence. Transgressive sand bodies created by wave reworking of the delta evolve from headland beaches and spits, to barrier islands, and finally to submarine shoals as the abandonment phase is completed.},

abstract = {Most methods for interpreting water-leaving reflectance assume vertical homogeneity in the water column. This approach is relevant to quite homogeneous waters or to very turbid waters where reflectance is related to the optical properties of a thin upper surface layer. In weakly turbid and stratified waters, water-leaving reflectance depends on the vertical profile of each optically significant component. This study presents a semi-empirical inversion method to estimate Total Suspended Matter (TSM) concentrations from reflectances in sediment-dominated and stratified waters. The method derives from the concept of a remote sensing estimate of concentration, which is calculated from the profile of suspended matter concentration and from the profile of diffuse attenuation coefficient. A simplification is introduced when the diffuse attenuation profile is not known. The simplified method can be applied to satellite data to retrieve 'optically-effective' concentrations showing better correlations with reflectances than subsurface concentrations. The method is extensively described in the paper and is applied, as an example, to field measurements and to SPOT data over the Ebro river mouth area. Its potential use in connection with numerical modelling of suspended sediment transport is also discussed.},

abstract = {In this paper, we develop and apply a framework for estimating the potential global-scale impact of reservoir construction on riverine sediment transport to the ocean. Using this framework, we discern a large, global-scale, and growing impact from anthropogenic impoundment. Our study links information on 633 of the world's largest reservoirs (LRs) (≥ 0.5 km3 maximum storage capacity) to the geography of continental discharge and uses statistical inferences to assess the potential impact of the remaining {\textgreater}44,000 smaller reservoirs (SRs). Information on the LRs was linked to a digitized river network at 30′ (latitude x longitude) spatial resolution. A residence time change ($\Delta$$\tau$R) for otherwise free-flowing river water is determined locally for each reservoir and used with a sediment retention function to predict the proportion of incident sediment flux trapped within each impoundment. The discharge-weighted mean $\Delta$$\tau$R for individual impoundments distributed across the globe is 0.21 years for LRs and 0.011 years for SRs. More than 40{\%} of global river discharge is intercepted locally by the LRs analyzed here, and a significant proportion (≈ 70{\%}) of this discharge maintains a theoretical sediment trapping efficiency in excess of 50{\%}. Half of all discharge entering LRs shows a local sediment trapping efficiency of 80{\%} or more. Analysis of the recent history of river impoundment reveals that between 1950 and 1968, there was tripling from 5{\%} to 15{\%} in global LR sediment trapping, another doubling to 30{\%} by 1985, and stabilization thereafter. Several large basins such as the Colorado and Nile show nearly complete trapping due to large reservoir construction and flow diversion. From the standpoint of sediment retention rates, the most heavily regulated drainage basins reside in Europe. North America, Africa, and Australia/Oceania are also strongly affected by LRs. Globally, greater than 50{\%} of basin-scale sediment flux in regulated basins is potentially trapped in artificial impoundments, with a discharge-weighted sediment trapping due to LRs of 30{\%}, and an additional contribution of 23{\%} from SRs. If we consider both regulated and unregulated basins, the interception of global sediment flux by all registered reservoirs (n ≈ 45,000) is conservatively placed at 4-5 Gt year-1 or 25-30{\%} of the total. There is an additional but unknown impact due to still smaller unregistered impoundments (n ≈ 800,000). Our results demonstrate that river impoundment should now be considered explicitly in global elemental flux studies, such as for water, sediment, carbon, and nutrients. From a global change perspective, the long-term impact of such hydraulic engineering works on the world's coastal zone appears to be significant but has yet to be fully elucidated. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {A laboratory experiment was conducted to determine the spectral characteristics of different types of sediment under suspension in water and to select an optimal wavelength for the quantification of suspended sediment concentration and secchi depth (water clarity) in the Tawa reservoir, using the Indian Remote Sensing Satellite-1A Linear Imaging Self Scanning Scanner-I (IRS-1A LISS-I) data. It was noted that the correlation between suspended sediment concentration and reflected radiance varied with colour, mineral composition of sediment and grain size. The clay minerals of low specific gravity had a larger value of reflected radiance than those from high specific gravity non-clay minerals. The laboratory results indicated that an algorithm to quantify suspended sediment concentration and secchi depth in the reservoir can be developed from reflected radiance received by the satellite. For this purpose the Tawa reservoir on the Tawa river of the Narmada basin in Central India was selected. Tawa reservoir water samples were collected on 20 October, 1988 concurrent with an IRS-1A overpass. The secchi depth, pH, and conductivity measurements were made at all the sampling points. The samples were analysed to determine the concentration of total suspended matter, grain size and mineralogy. A positive functional relation exists between the concentration of suspended solids and the visible wavelength bands 1, 2 and 3 (0.45 to 0.68 mu m). On the other hand, the secchi depth of water increases with the decrease in reflected radiance. It has been observed that concentration, mineralogy and grain size of the suspended solids are the main factors which influence the reflected radiance.},

abstract = {Maintaining the ecological diversity and hydrologic connectivity of freshwater delta systems depends on regular recharge of floodplains with river water, which can be difficult to observe on the ground. Rivers that form deltas often carry large amounts of suspended sediment, but floodplain lakes and wetlands usually have little sediment in suspension. Remote observation of high sediment water in lakes and wetlands therefore often indicates connectivity with the river network. In this study, we use daily 250-m MODIS imagery in band 1 (620-670nm) and band 2 (841-876nm) to monitor suspended sediment transport and, by proxy, hydrologic recharge in the Peace-Athabasca Delta, Canada. To identify an appropriate suspended sediment concentration (SSC)-reflectance model, we compare 31 published empirical equations using a field dataset containing 147 observations of SSC and in situ spectral reflectance. Results suggest potential for spatial transferability of such models, but success is contingent on the equation meeting certain criteria: 1) use of a near infrared band in combination with at least one visible band, 2) development based on SSCs similar to those in the observed region, and 3) a nonlinear form. Using a highly predictive SSC-reflectance model (Spearman's $\rho$=0.95), we develop a twelve-year time series of SSC in the westernmost end of Lake Athabasca, observe the timing and sources of major sediment flux events, and identify a threshold river discharge of {\~{}}1700m3/s above which SSC in Lake Athabasca is clearly associated with flow in the Athabasca River. We also track the influx of Athabasca River water to floodplain lakes, and in three of the lakes identify distinct discharge thresholds (1040m3/s, 1150m3/s, and 1850m3/s) which result in lake recharge. For each of these lakes, we find a statistically significant decline in the threshold exceedence frequency since 1970, suggesting less frequent recharge during the summer. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Landsat archive contains nearly three million Landsat images. All USGS Landsat data are available at no cost via the Internet. The USGS is committed to improving the content of the historical Landsat archive though the consolidation of Landsat data held in international archives. In addition, the USGS is working on a strategy to develop higher-level Landsat geo- and biophysical datasets. Finally, Federal efforts are underway to transition Landsat into a sustained operational program within the Department of the Interior and to authorize the development of the next two satellites - Landsats 9 and 10. {\textcopyright} 2012.},

abstract = {Satellite-based remote monitoring programs of regional lake water quality largely have relied on Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) owing to its long image archive, moderate spatial resolution (30. m), and wide sensitivity in the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, despite some notable limitations such as temporal resolution (i.e., 16. days), data pre-processing requirements to improve data quality, and aging satellites. Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors on Aqua/Terra platforms compensate for these shortcomings, although at the expense of spatial resolution. We developed and evaluated a remote monitoring protocol for water clarity of large lakes using MODIS 500. m data and compared MODIS utility to Landsat-based methods. MODIS images captured during May-September 2001, 2004 and 2010 were analyzed with linear regression to identify the relationship between lake water clarity and satellite-measured surface reflectance. Correlations were strong (R 2 = 0.72-0.94) throughout the study period; however, they were the most consistent in August, reflecting seasonally unstable lake conditions and inter-annual differences in algal productivity during the other months. The utility of MODIS data in remote water quality estimation lies in intra-annual monitoring of lake water clarity in inaccessible, large lakes, whereas Landsat is more appropriate for inter-annual, regional trend analyses of lakes ≥. 8. ha. Model accuracy is improved when ancillary variables are included to reflect seasonal lake dynamics and weather patterns that influence lake clarity. The identification of landscape-scale drivers of regional water quality is a useful way to supplement satellite-based remote monitoring programs relying on spectral data alone. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc..},

abstract = {The dynamics of coastal lagoons and estuarine areas is characterized by a delicate balance between biological and physical processes and the comprehension and monitoring of such processes require observations over a wide range of temporal and spatial scales. Remote sensing techniques in this context are very advantageous and potentially allow overcoming the spatial limitations of traditional in situ point observations, providing new opportunities for a better understanding of the relevant bio-geomorphological processes and for the calibration and validation of spatially-distributed hydrodynamic and transport models. Remote sensing of suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentration in shallow waters must, however, overcome the difficulties associated with i) the influence of bottom reflection, which may interfere with an accurate retrieval; ii) the necessity of accurately knowing the optical properties of the suspended matter, and iii) the importance of providing an assessment of the uncertainty associated with the estimates produced. This work presents a method to estimate SPM concentration in lagoon/estuarine waters by use of a simplified radiative transfer model. We use a calibration/validation method based on cross-validation and bootstrap techniques to provide a statistically sound determination of model parameters and an evaluation of the uncertainty induced by their inaccurate determination as well as by the uncertain knowledge of the bottom sediment reflectance. The method is applied to the Venice lagoon, using observations from a network of turbidity sensors and from several multispectral satellite sensors (LANDSAT, ASTER and ALOS AVNIR). The bootstrap and cross-validation procedures employed show that consistent estimates of SPM concentration can indeed be retrieved from satellite remote sensing, provided that sufficient in situ ancillary information for appropriate calibration is available. The quantification of the estimation uncertainty shows that retrievals obtained from remote sensing are accurate, robust and repeatable. The SPM concentration maps produced show a general coherence with known features in the Venice lagoon and, together with suitable biological information, point to the role played by benthic vegetation in the stabilization of the bottom sediment. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {We evaluated MERIS spectral inversion processors in the estimation of chlorophyll a (Chl-a), total suspended matter (TSM), absorption of colored dissolved organic matter (aCDOM at 443nm) and Secchi disk transparency (ZSD) in four lakes located in southern Finland. The lakes represent oligotrophic, mesotrophic and humic (high aCDOM, low TSM) lake types. Our validation data was extensive, consisting of remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) measured in the field, detailed measurements of (specific) inherent optical properties ((S)IOP) and water quality measurements. Validation measurements were collected at stations and as spatially intensive transects. The tested processors were Boreal lakes (BOR) and Free University of Berlin WeW WATER processor (FUB). In the case of BOR we included two versions, the original one available in 2008 and the most recent version. The processing chains of these versions differed in terms of MERIS archive reprocessing (2nd reprocessing (RP2) and 3rd reprocessing (RP3) were used), version of adjacency effect correction (ICOL) and rectification method. However, all these had only minor effect on the estimated Rrs when compared to the effect caused by the differences in the atmospheric correction versions. The use of ICOL improved the estimation of Rrs and therefore all IOP and water quality validations were made with ICOL pre-processed data. Rrs was best estimated with RP2 BOR, although it somewhat overestimated Rrs in blue in the humic lake. RP3 BOR greatly overestimated the Rrs in blue. FUB was outside its aCDOM training range in most of the studied lakes. RP2 BOR estimated water quality with the best accuracy in mesotrophic lakes, but failed in humic and clear water lakes. BOR overestimated Chl-a, particularly with RP3. The best TSM correlation was for RP2 BOR. All processors underestimated aCDOM. The SIOP measurements showed that overestimation of Chl-a was not due to incorrect conversion factors, and that underestimation of TSM was to some extent explained by lower average conversion factor than that measured in the validation lakes. The inaccuracies in Chl-a and aCDOM(443) estimation were related to the partition of atot to phytoplankton and CDOM absorption, which emphasizes the importance of including IOP measurements in the validation studies. ZSD was best estimated on the basis of atot and btot, which were separately calculated from BOR output and the bio-optical model assumed in the processor. For the needs of transparency estimation the processors should produce atot and btot for all MERIS bands as standard output. Atmospheric correction over humic lakes is another problem to be solved in future versions of the processors. The 2008 version of BOR provided better atmospheric correction results in humic lakes and is thus more applicable in the boreal zone where these lakes are common. This suggests that before a new processor version is published it should be validated with existing in situ data.},

The computation is performed with respect to the summer situation of the Gulf of Naples (Mediterranean Sea). The sensitivity of the retrieval of each parameter to variations in the concentration of the two other quantities is investigated by numerical simulations. The sensitivity to the variability of the absorption and scattering properties of phytoplankton and suspended sediment is analyzed, as well as the error induced by the uncertainty of the remote-sensing data. The algorithms's performance is satisfactorily tested on sets of SeaWiFS band reflectances randomly generated within wide water composition ranges.

abstract = {Water siltation caused by artisanal gold mining has impacted the Tapaj{\'{o}}s River Basin in Brazil for the past 40. years, however spatial-temporal information about changes in water quality and consequences to the aquatic environment is lacking. To address this, the Landsat satellite family sensors were used to retrieve total suspended solids (TSS) of the water of the Tapaj{\'{o}}s River from 1973 to 2013. An image processing approach that includes atmospheric correction, based on the 6S model, and glint removing, based on shortwave infrared correction, was applied and validated with in situ radiometric data. An optimization of the atmospheric correction having dark dense forest spectra as reference was applied and allowed a robust correction of MSS, TM and OLI signal to surface reflectance values. Sediment concentration was estimated based on a non-linear empirical regression between measured TSS and satellite surface reflectance at red band. The multi-temporal analysis of TSS showed that the sediment load in the Tapaj{\'{o}}s aquatic system is in synchrony with mining activities, and a constant seasonal variation of water siltation is observed throughout the time frame of this study. At the end of the rainy season, mining activities intensify and, coupled with low water flow, TSS increases. During the high water level, TSS concentrations were consistently lower because of high water dilution and low mining activity. In a decadal analysis, a peak of sediment concentration coincides with a peak of gold production in all sites analyzed during early 1990s. More recently, due to the currently gold rush, an increase in suspended solids has been observed mainly in the Novo and Tocantins rivers where industrial mining has been installed.},

abstract = {The reflectance properties of lakes in the Adirondack mountain region are described. Five distinct types of reflectance spectra are identified and related to differcnccs in water quality. No relationship was found between reflectance and acidification status. A reflectance model based on literature absorbance and scattering cross-sections of water, plant pigments, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and suspended inorganic matter is used to generate reflectance spectra of each reflectance type. Use of a variable Q factor during the conversion of remotely sensed reflectance to irradiance reflectance improves the correspondence between mea-sured and modeled irradiance reflectance spectra. Comparison of measured reflectance with model reflectance also demonstrates the importance of small concentration changes as well as the inter-active influence of plant pigments, DOC, and suspended material on lake color. Correlograms depict the wavelength-dependent relationships between reflectance and water qual-ity. Plant pigments, DOC, and suspended material are negatively correlated with reflectance from 400 to 600 nm and positively correlated from 600 to 750 nm; parameters associated with lake acidification, pH, alkalinity, and aluminum concentrations are poorly correlated with reflectance. Adirondack lakes exhibit a high degree of covariance between pigment, DOC, and suspended matter concentrations. Regression models predicting total pigments and DOC are developed which suggest that these parameters can be estimated remotely in these lakes, but remote estimation of pH, alkalinity, and aluminum is not possible with reflectance measures. A regression model estimating total pigments from the reflectance ratio of 525 : 554 nm is similar in slope and accuracy to one derived for the Coastal Zone Color Scanner (CZCS) for coastal marine waters. However, neither of the " recom-mended " CZCS pigment algorithms perform best with the Adirondack lake reflectance and pigment Remote sensing of water quality relies on the relationships among the remotely esti-mated radiance scattered out of the water, the inherent water column absorption and Philpot of the Cornell Laboratory for the Environ-mental Applications of Remote Sensing (CLEARS) is gratefully acknowledged.

abstract = {The location and persistence of surface water (inland and coastal) is both affected by climate and human activity1 and affects climate2, 3, biological diversity4 and human wellbeing5, 6. Global data sets documenting surface water location and seasonality have been produced from inventories and national descriptions7, statistical extrapolation of regional data8 and satellite imagery9, 10, 11, 12, but measuring long-term changes at high resolution remains a challenge. Here, using three million Landsat satellite images13, we quantify changes in global surface water over the past 32 years at 30-metre resolution. We record the months and years when water was present, where occurrence changed and what form changes took in terms of seasonality and persistence. Between 1984 and 2015 permanent surface water has disappeared from an area of almost 90,000 square kilometres, roughly equivalent to that of Lake Superior, though new permanent bodies of surface water covering 184,000 square kilometres have formed elsewhere. All continental regions show a net increase in permanent water, except Oceania, which has a fractional (one per cent) net loss. Much of the increase is from reservoir filling, although climate change14 is also implicated. Loss is more geographically concentrated than gain. Over 70 per cent of global net permanent water loss occurred in the Middle East and Central Asia, linked to drought and human actions including river diversion or damming and unregulated withdrawal15, 16. Losses in Australia17 and the USA18 linked to long-term droughts are also evident. This globally consistent, validated data set shows that impacts of climate change and climate oscillations on surface water occurrence can be measured and that evidence can be gathered to show how surface water is altered by human activities. We anticipate that this freely available data will improve the modelling of surface forcing, provide evidence of state and change in wetland ecotones (the transition areas between biomes), and inform water-management decision-making.},

abstract = {An experimental method for determining water composition from "ocean colour" satellite data, in visible and near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths, is applied to highly turbid waters. Numerous spectroradiometric measurements are carried out in the Gironde estuary, for suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentrations ranging between 35 and more than 2000 mg l-1. Empirical relationships are established between remote-sensing reflectance (Rrs) in SPOT-HRV bands and SPM concentration through these numerous in situ measurements. We observed that remote-sensing reflectance increases with SPM concentration and that the SPOT bands saturate at the highest turbidities. The best correlations are obtained for the NIR band XS3 (790-890 nm) and for the reflectance ratios: Rrs(XS3)/Rrs(XS1) and Rrs(XS3)/Rrs(XS2). The XS1 and XS2 visible bands are only used to determine SPM concentrations in the lower part of the estuary (where the SPM concentrations are lower). As a result, SPM concentrations within the surface waters in the estuary are estimated up to 2000 mg l-1 with an accuracy better than ±35{\%}. The algorithm is finally applied to a SPOT scene. Satellite data are corrected for atmospheric effects using a radiative transfer code and in situ reflectance measurements; as a result, the horizontal distribution of SPM is retrieved. Moreover, the high spatial resolution HRV-SPOT sensor shows detailed sedimentary flows, especially in the visible XS1 and XS2 spectral bands. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

abstract = {The goal of this study was to determine the extent to which mixing and stratification processes influence the horizontal surface phytoplankton distribution in a tropical hydroelectric reservoir in Brazil. We used a synergistic approach that combines remote sensing bio-optical empirical and three-dimensional hydrodynamic modeling to represent phytoplankton dynamics. Seasonal differences were evaluated by simulating the bio-optical and the three-dimensional hydrodynamic models for two periods: the austral summer and winter of 2009. The three-dimensional hydrodynamic model simulations showed that the water column was completely mixed during winter; the water column remained stratified during summer. We also noticed a permanent thermocline during the summer between 15 and 25m in the reservoir. In both seasons, the surface current was wind driven and preferentially directed eastward. The bio-optical model showed that the horizontal surface phytoplankton distribution, as indicated by chlorophyll-a concentration, was heterogeneous during winter and homogenous during summer. Moreover, higher concentrations were observed by the empirical bio-optical model during winter (the highest mean areal concentration was 24$\mu$gL-1) than in summer (2.1$\mu$gL-1). This difference was explained by short timescale events, such as cold front passages, which contributed to the proliferation of phytoplankton in winter by enhancing vertical mixing in the water column. Lake number analysis showed that upwelling events were the most common mechanisms driving the mixing process during winter (LN{\textless}1 82{\%} of the time). Combining remote sensing and three-dimensional hydrodynamic modeling makes it possible to more fully analyze the dynamics of the horizontal surface phytoplankton distribution under different meteorological conditions. The two modeling techniques can be used in a complementary manner and serve as an essential tool for the environmental monitoring of aquatic systems.},

abstract = {Remotely sensed images derived from several sources were combined with in situ samples to estimate suspended sediments discharged from three rivers into Mayaguez Bay, Puerto Rico. Multispectral data were acquired using the Calibrated Airborne Multispectral Scanner (CAMS) and the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM). CAMS data were used to produce spatial maps of suspended sediment concentrations in Mayaquez Bay during low to moderate discharge for 1990-1992. Images of land cover/land use during 1975 and 1985 were generated from a supervised density slicing technique applied to a mosaicked image of digitized aerial photos and from an unsupervised classification of the TM image. A geomorphic hydrologic model was used to simulate runoff and sediment yield from the drainage basin of the Guanajibo river; because land cover within the basin did not change significantly during 1975-1985, the hydrologic model provided estimates of sediment discharged by the Guanajibo river into the bay during this time period. Growth rates of the coral Montastrea annularis of Rodriguez reef were obtained from a previous study. Annual growth rates as determined from coral banding decreased significantly (r = 0.69) with increased sediment loading to the bay (tons/year). Evidence from remote sensing and hydrologic modeling suggests that sediment reaches the reef only during episodic, high-discharge events. During low to moderate discharge, sediments, both suspended within the river plume and resuspended sediments, are restricted to the near-shore regions by the prevailing circulation. Hence, a direct relationship between river runoff and coral growth rates was established in this study. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

abstract = {Appalachian USA surface coal mines face public and regulatory pressure to reduce total dissolved solids (TDS) in discharge waters, primarily due to effects on sensitive macroinvertebrates. Specific conductance (SC) is an accurate surrogate for TDS and relatively low levels of SC (300–500 $\mu$S cm−1) have been proposed as regulatory benchmarks for instream water quality. Discharge levels of TDS from regional coal mines are frequently {\textgreater}1000 $\mu$S cm−1. The primary objectives of this study were to (a) determine the effect of rock type and weathering status on SC leaching potentials for a wide range of regional mine spoils; (b) to relate leachate SC from laboratory columns to actual measured discharge SC from field sites; and (c) determine effective rapid lab analyses for SC prediction of overburden materials. We correlated laboratory unsaturated column leaching results for 39 overburden materials with a range of static lab parameters such as total-S, saturated paste SC, and neutralization potential. We also compared column data with available field leaching and valley fill discharge SC data. Leachate SC is strongly related to rock type and pre-disturbance weathering. Fine-textured and non-weathered strata generally produced higher SC and pose greater TDS risk. High-S black shales produced the highest leachate SC. Lab columns generated similar range and overall SC decay response to field observations within 5–10 leaching cycles, while actual reduction in SC in the field occurs over years to decades. Initial peak SC can be reliably predicted (R2 {\textgreater} 0.850; p {\textless} 0.001) by simple lab saturated paste or 1:2 spoil:water SC procedures, but predictions of longer-term SC levels are less reliable and deserve further study. Overall TDS release risk can be accurately predicted by a combination of rock type + S content, weathering extent, and simple rapid SC lab measurements.},

The water quality monitoring that is critical to the management of this important water resource and ecosystem relies primarily on a system of fixed water-quality monitoring stations, but the limited spatial coverage often hinders understanding. Here, we show how the latest technology in visible/near-infrared imaging spectroscopy can facilitate water quality monitoring in this highly dynamic and heterogeneous system by enabling simultaneous depictions of several water quality indicators at very high spatial resolution. The airborne portable remote imaging spectrometer (PRISM) was used to derive high-spatial-resolution (2.6 × 2.6 m) distributions of turbidity, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and chlorophyll-a concentrations in a wetland-influenced region of this estuary. A filter-passing methylmercury vs DOC relationship was also developed using in situ samples and enabled the high-spatial-resolution depiction of surface methylmercury concentrations in this area. The results illustrate how high-resolution imaging spectroscopy can inform management and policy development in important inland and estuarine water bodies by facilitating the detection of point- and nonpoint-source pollution, and by providing data to help assess the complex impacts of wetland restoration and climate change on water quality and ecosystem productivity.},

abstract = {The aim of this study is to derive parameters from spectral variations associated with heavy metals in soil and to explore the possibility of extending the use of these parameters to hyperspectral images and to map the distribution of areas affected by heavy metals on HyMAP data. Variations in the spectral absorption features of lattice OH and oxygen on the mineral surface due to the combination of different heavy metals were linked to actual concentrations of heavy metals. The ratio of 610 to 500 nm (R610,500 nm) in the visible and near-infrared (VNIR) range, absorption area at 2200 nm (Area2200 nm), and asymmetry of the absorption feature at 2200 nm (Asym2200 nm) showed significant correlations with concentrations of Pb, Zn, and As, respectively. The resulting spectral gradient maps showed similar spatial patterns to geochemical gradient maps. The ground-derived spectral parameters showed a reliable quantitative relationship with heavy metal levels based on multiple linear regression. To examine the feasibility to applying these parameters to a HyMAP image, image-derived spectral parameters were compared with ground-derived parameters in terms of R2, one-way ANOVA, and spatial patterns in the gradient map. The R1344,778 nmand Area2200 nmparameters showed a weak relationship between the two datasets (R2{\textgreater} 0.5), and populations of spectral parameter values, Depth500 nm, R1344,778 nm, and Area2200 nmderived from the image pixels were comparable with those of ground-derived spectral parameters along a section of the stream channel. The pixels classified in the rule image of Depth500 nm, R1344,778 nm, and Area2200 nmderived from a HyMAP image showed similar spatial patterns to the gradient maps of ground-derived spectral parameters. The results indicate the potential applicability of the parameters derived from spectral absorption features in screening and mapping the distribution of heavy metals. Correcting for differences in spectral and spatial resolution between ground and image spectra should be considered for quantitative mapping and the retrieval of heavy metal concentrations from HyMAP images. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Bio-optical measurements and sampling were carried out in the delta of the Lena River (northern Siberia, Russia) between 26 June and 4 July 2011. The aim of this study was to determine the inherent optical properties of the Lena water, i.e., absorption, attenuation, and scattering coefficients, during the period of maximum runoff. This aimed to contribute to the development of a bio-optical model for use as the basis for optical remote sensing of coastal water of the Arctic. In this context the absorption by CDOM (colored dissolved organic matter) and particles, and the concentrations of total suspended matter, phytoplankton-pigments, and carbon were measured. CDOM was found to be the most dominant parameter affecting the optical properties of the river, with an absorption coefficient of 4.5–5 m−1 at 442 nm, which was almost four times higher than total particle absorption values at visible wavelength range. The wavelenght-dependence of absorption of the different water constituents was chracterized by determining the semi logarithmic spectral slope. Mean CDOM, and detritus slopes were 0.0149 nm−1(standard deviation (stdev) = 0.0003, n = 18), and 0.0057 nm−1 (stdev = 0.0017, n = 19), respectively, values which are typical for water bodies with high concentrations of dissolved and particulate carbon. Mean chlorophyll a and total suspended matter were 1.8 mg m−3 (stdev = 0.734 n = 18) and 31.9 g m−3 (stdev = 19.94, n = 27), respectively. DOC (dissolved organic carbon) was in the range 8–10 g m−3 and the total particulate carbon (PC) in the range 0.25–1.5 g m−3. The light penetration depth (Secchi disc depth) was in the range 30–90 cm and was highly correlated with the suspended matter concentration. The period of maximum river runoff in June was chosen to obtain bio-optical data when maximum water constituents are transported into the Laptev Sea. However, we are aware that more data from other seasons and other years need to be collected to establish a general bio-optical model of the Lena water and conclusively characterize the light climate with respect to primary production.},

Synoptic information on suspended matter cannot be obtained from an in situ monitoring network since suspended matter is a spatially inhomogeneous parameter. This problem can be solved by the integrated use of remote sensing data, in situ data and water quality models. To enable retrospective model and remote sensing data comparison of suspended matter concentration and distribution, a methodology is required for processing satellite images that is independent of in situ measurements. Analytical optical modelling, based on knowledge of the in situ inherent optical properties, leads to reliable multi-temporal algorithms for estimating suspended matter concentration in lakes for the data from the SPOT and Landsat TM sensors. This methodology allows multi-temporal, multi-site and multi-instrument comparison of TSM maps derived from satellite imagery. This means that satellite sensor data can now become an independent measurement tool for water management authorities. The remote sensing maps showed that large gradients in TSM were observed for the various lakes as well as temporal changes of these spatial gradients. In situ point samples are shown to be not representative for suspended matter in the lakes.},

The reliability of the data was evaluated by examining the precision of repeated measurements on individual lakes within short time periods using data from adjacent overlapping Landsat paths and by comparing water clarity computed from Landsat data to field-collected Secchi depth data. The agreement between satellite data and field measurements of Secchi depth within Landsat paths was strong (average R2 of 0.83 and range 0.71-0.96). Relationships between late-summer Landsat and field-measured Secchi depth for the combined statewide data similarly were strong (r2 of 0.77-0.80 for individual time periods and r2 = 0.78 for the entire database). Lake clarity has strong geographic patterns in Minnesota; lakes in the south and southwest have low clarity, and lakes in the north and northeast tend to have the highest clarity. This pattern is evident at both the individual lake and the ecoregion level. Mean water clarity in the Northern Lakes and Forest and North Central Hardwood Forest ecoregions in central and northern Minnesota remained stable from 1985 to 2005 while decreasing water clarity trends were detected in the Western Corn Belt Plains and Northern Glaciated Plains ecoregions in southern Minnesota, where agriculture is the predominant land use. Mean water clarity at the statewide level also remained stable with an average around 2.25 m from 1985 to 2005. This assessment demonstrates that satellite imagery can provide an accurate method for obtaining comprehensive spatial and temporal coverage of key water quality characteristics that can be used to detect trends at different geographic scales. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {There have been major improvements in our understanding of the role of lakes and impoundments in global carbon cycle. Estimating the true role of lakes as sentinels, regulators and integrators of climate change requires analyzing carbon content of vast number of lakes. This is not realistic without using remote sensing methods. There are no satellite sensors at the moment that provide full global coverage and at the same time have spatial and radiometric resolutions suitable for lake color dissolved organic matter (CDOM) mapping. Therefore, the global study has to be performed using more sensitive sensors to create regional lake CDOM statistics for as many sites as possible and extrapolating the results on global lake map that can be created from less sensitive sensor data with full global coverage (Landsat). As a first step towards the global lake carbon mapping we show that the Advanced Land Imager (ALI) allows to study regional variations in lake CDOM content and consequently estimate closely correlated DOC (dissolved organic carbon) and CO2 saturation values. The results show also that there may be regional differences in lake CDOM content even if the study sites are geographically relatively close to each other and occupying zones with similar land cover and annual runoff. In one occasion the difference can be explained with human impact that has caused acidification of lakes but the other occasion needs further studies.},

abstract = {Suspended matter plays an important role in water quality management since it is related to total primary production and fluxes of heavy metals and micropollutants such as PCBs. Synoptic information on suspended matter at a regular frequency is difficult to obtain from the routine in situ monitoring network since suspended matter is (like chlorophyll) a spatially inhomogeneous parameter. This can be solved by the integrated use of remote sensing data, in situ data and water quality models. A methodology previously developed for integrating information from remote sensing, and models (Vos and Schuttelaar, Neth Remote Sensing Board (1995) report 95-19), was applied for the assessment of suspended matter concentrations in the southern Frisian lakes in the Netherlands. The model is a one-dimensional network model. Remote sensing data (Landsat-TM5 and SPOT-HRV) were atmospherically corrected and converted to total suspended matter maps. The algorithms are based on analytical optical modelling, using the in situ inherent optical properties. This methodology enables the development of multi-temporal algorithms for estimating seston dry weight concentration in lakes from remotely sensed data; thus satellite data can now become an independent measurement tool for water management authorities.

A little weird. Uses bio-optical model developed by decker 1998, but they have almost zero in situ data for validation.

In situ reflectance was gathered to calibrate physical model. They back calculated TSM based on in situ Secchi and Chl-a data.

Paper makes a lot of assumption about atmophere, TSS composition, and radiative transfer function},

abstract = {The water clarity of many inland water bodies is under threat due to intensifying land use pressures in conjunction with changes in water levels that result from increasing demand and climate variability. The recent launch of Landsat 8 coupled with Geoscience Australia's recent reprocessing of the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM +) archives over the whole of Australia to a consistent surface reflectance product enables sub continental scale spatio-temporal analysis of freshwater optical water quality in support of monitoring and decision making for water management agencies. In this research, we present an objective assessment of the potential of Landsat 5 TM, Landsat 7 ETM + and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data for monitoring inland water quality dynamics over a number of lakes and reservoirs with a range of optical water types in New South Wales and Queensland, Australia. We used bio-optical modelling to develop sensor-specific total suspended matter (TSM) retrieval algorithms that account for the difference in relative spectral response between Landsat 7 ETM + and Landsat 8 OLI. We were able to compare the suitability of the different sensors for optical water quality measurements using water bodies that fell within Landsat path overlaps where Landsat images of surface reflectance were acquired within 24 h between Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 7 ETM + or Landsat 7 ETM + and Landsat 8 OLI. These water bodies represent a range of hydrological and limnological conditions, and enabled us to assess: 1) the comparability of TSM measurements retrieved from each sensor, and 2) the surface reflectance to image noise characteristics of Landsat 7 ETM + and Landsat 8 OLI. Comparisons of lake surface reflectance and noise equivalent reflectance difference show that the improved radiometric resolution and increased quantization of Landsat 8 OLI relative to Landsat 7 ETM + significantly reduce image noise and spectral heterogeneity, indicating that Landsat 8 OLI data are expected to provide more precise water quality retrievals relative to Landsat 7 ETM +. We found that: 1) the TSM retrievals from the different sensors are highly comparable; 2) Landsat 5 TM overestimated TSM relative to Landsat 7 ETM + by 6.4{\%}; and 3) Landsat 7 ETM + overestimated TSM relative to Landsat 8 OLI by only 1.4{\%}. Retrieved TSM values were highly correlated with independent in situ data acquired within 24 h of satellite overpass (r = 0.99) with a mean average error of 14 mg/L. The results demonstrate that time series analysis of TSM retrievals can be conducted across a wide range of lakes at the sub-continental scale to characterise the multi-decadal TSM dynamics.},

Paper attempts to generalize bio-optical across optically hetergenous sites in eastern Australia (Ecolight 5.0)

Model calibration done with 59 sets of complete IOPs.

L8 results in slightly higher TSM concentrations because of width of red band? Not sure if thats an artifact of their model or of the sensor.

Used Fmak, cloud algorithm, and shortwave infrared filter for cloudmasking

SWIR filtering also reduces sun-gint, algal mats, and floating macrophytes.

24 hour overpass coincidence window

Check Vanhellemont and Ruddick correction

Overall the model overestimates TSM at low concentrations but does a pretty good job otherwise. OLI sensor has better signal to noise ratio,

This article gives a thorough review of empirical algorithms for quantitatively estimating a variety of parameters from space-borne, airborne and in situ remote sensors in inland and transitional waters, including chlorophyll-a, total suspended solids, Secchi disk depth (z(SD)), turbidity, absorption by coloured dissolved organic matter (a(CDOM)) and other parameters, for example, phycocyanin. Current remote-sensing instruments are also reviewed. The theoretical basis of the empirical algorithms is given using fundamental bio-optical theory of the inherent optical properties (IOPs). Bands, band ratios and band arithmetic algorithms that could be used to produce common biogeophysical products for inland/transitional waters are identified. The article discusses the potential role that empirical algorithms could play alongside more advanced model-based algorithms in the future of water remote sensing, especially for near real-time operational monitoring systems.

abstract = {The potential strengths and limitations of the Landsat systems for water clarity and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) measurement were evaluated in Minnesota in the summers of 2013 and 2014. Optical water quality characteristics, including chlorophyll a, total suspended solids (TSS), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and CDOM were collected along with imagery from Landsats 7 and 8. Sites represented a wide range of concentrations of CDOM, chlorophyll, and mineral suspended solids (MSS), the primary factors that affect reflectance. Clear images from September 24, 2013 (Landsat 7) and September 16, 2013 (Landsat 8) acquired for northern Minnesota eight days apart allowed comparison of the respective ETM + and OLI sensors for CDOM measurements. We examined a wide variety of potential band and band ratio models and found some two-variable models that included the NIR band worked well for Landsat 8 (R2 = 0.82) and reasonably well for Landsat 7 (R2 = 0.74). The commonly used green/red model had a poor fit for both sensors (R2 = 0.24, 0.25), and five sites with high MSS were clear outliers. Exclusion of these sites and other sites not included with the Landsat 7 dataset yielded a less optically complex subset of 20 coincident lakes. For this subset strong models were found for many band and band ratio models, including the commonly used green/red model with R2 = 0.79 for Landsat 7 and R2 = 0.81 for Landsat 8. The less optically complex subset may explain why the green/red model has worked well in other areas. For optically complex waters CDOM models that used the new Landsat 8 ultra-blue and narrower NIR band worked best for the full dataset indicating that the new bands and other Landsat 8 characteristics, such as higher radiometric sensitivity and improved signal-to-noise ratios, improve CDOM measurements. For water clarity measured as Secchi depth (SD), we compared September 1, 2008 Landsat 7 and August 22, 2013 Landsat 8 images from path 28 using stepwise regression to identify the best model using all bands and band ratios including the new blue and narrower NIR band. The best water clarity model for Landsat 8 used the OLI 2/4 band ratio plus OLI band 1 and was nearly identical with a model using the OLI 2/4 band ratio plus OLI band 2. The latter model is similar to the model used for previous Landsat water clarity assessments, which used the ETM + 1/3 band ratio plus ETM + band 1. For SD measurements we found strong relationships with both sensors, with only slight improvements for the OLI sensor for the lakes in our datasets. In contrast to some previous reports that indicated Landsat 7's ETM + lacked sufficient sensitivity for reliable retrieval of CDOM, we found that overall both sensors worked well for water clarity and CDOM measurements. This will allow their continued use for current and historical measurements of important water characteristics on a regional scale.},

abstract = {Accurate remote assessment of phytoplankton chlorophyll a (chla) concentration is particularly challenging in turbid, productive waters. Recently a conceptual model containing reflectance in three spectral bands in the red and near infra-red range of the spectrum was suggested for retrieving chla concentrations in turbid productive waters; it was calibrated and validated in lakes and reservoirs in Nebraska and Iowa. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the performance of this three band model as well as its special case, the two-band model to estimate chla concentration in Chesapeake Bay, as representative of estuarine Case II waters, and to assess the accuracy of chla retrieval. To evaluate the model performance, dual spectroradiometers were used to measure subsurface spectral radiance reflectance in the visible and near infra-red range of the spectrum. Water samples were collected concurrently and contained widely variable chla (9 to 77.4??mg/m3) and total suspended solids (7-65??mg/L dry wt). Colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) absorption at 440??nm was 0.20 to 2.50??m- 1; Secchi disk transparency ranged from 0.28 to 1.5??m. The two- and three-band models were spectrally tuned to select the spectral bands for most accurate chla estimation. Strong linear relationships were established between analytically measured chla and both the three-band model [R- 1(675)-R- 1(695)] ?? R(730) and the two-band model R(720)/R(670), where R(??) is reflectance at wavelength ??. The three-band model accounted for 81{\%} of variation in chla and allowed estimation of chla with a root mean square error (RMSE) of less than 7.9??mg/m3, whereas the two-band model accounted for 79{\%} of chla variability and RMSE of chla estimation was below 8.4??mg/m3. The three-band model with MERIS spectral bands allows accurate chla estimation with RMSE below 9.1??mg/m3. Two-band model with SeaWiFS bands and MODIS 667??nm and 748??nm bands can estimate chla with RMSE below 11??mg/m3. The findings underlined the rationale behind the conceptual model and demonstrated the robustness of this algorithm for chla retrieval in turbid, productive estuarine waters. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Under projected scenarios of sea-level rise, subsidence, and sediment starvation many deltas around the world are expected to drown. Delta growth dynamics, which determine the ability of a delta to adapt to these changes, are poorly understood due to the difficulty of measuring change in slowly evolving landscapes. We use time-series imagery of experimental, numerical, and field-scale deltas to derive four laws that govern the growth of river-dominated deltas. Land area grows at a constant rate in the absence of relative sea level change, while wetted area keeps pace, maintaining a constant wetted fraction over the delta surface. Scaling of edge-lengths versus areas suggests delta shorelines are nonfractal, even though the channel network is fractal. Consequently channel-edge length, which provides critical habitat, grows more rapidly than delta area. These laws provide a blueprint for delta growth that will aid in delta restoration and help predict how existing deltas will evolve.},

abstract = {This paper presents an application of a physic-based method that relies on spectral inversion procedures to simultaneously estimate concentrations of water constituents, water column heights (cH) and benthic substrate types in Lake Trasimeno (Italy) from airborne imaging spectrometry. Complex waters of this lake are challenging due to the coexistence of optically-deep turbid waters and of optically-shallow waters, mostly characterised by dense submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) beds. Airborne data acquired on 12 May 2009 by Multispectral Infrared and Visible Imaging Spectrometer (MIVIS) were converted into remote sensing reflectance Rrs($\lambda$) with the atmospheric correction code ATCOR. A spectral inversion procedure implementing a bio-optical model (namely BOMBER), parameterised with in situ data, was firstly run to retrieve concentrations of suspended particulate matter (SPM), chlorophyll-a (chl-a) and coloured dissolved organic matter (i.e. aCDOM(440)) in the optically-deep waters. The areas where the retrieved optimisation error was higher than 10{\%} were instead assumed as optically-shallow. In these areas two maps depicting the linear unmixing of three substrate types (i.e., silty-clay, Chara ssp. and other hydrophyte) and the water column heights were produced. The MIVIS-derived products were validated with field data providing a reliable estimation of SPM, chl-a, aCDOM(440) and cH (determination coefficients always R2{\textgreater}0.7). SPM concentrations were also similar to a 5.4-km long transect of flow-through turbidity data, and the SAV map was comparable to in situ observations. Generally, the colonisation patterns of SAV were reflecting the spatial distribution of SPM concentrations. In particular, the positive role of Chara on keeping SPM concentrations low was observed. Future research should extend this application to remote sensing data acquired in other seasons to trace the dynamics of SAV and its effect on spatial water clarity.},

abstract = {A fundamental measure to characterize water quality is the attenuation coefficient for downward planar irradiance in the water column. In this paper we present an analytical forward model and develop an inversion scheme (2SeaColor) to retrieve the downwelling attenuation coefficients from remote sensing data. The forward formulation of 2SeaColor provides an analytical and stable solution of the direct and diffuse components of the radiative transfer equation. The common high turbidity of inland waters is accounted for in 2SeaColor by projecting its effect on the inherent optical properties (IOPs) using the similarity transform. The inversion scheme of 2SeaColor uses a novel approach to parameterize the spectral dependency of IOPs. In this parameterization 2SeaColor uses the curvature information of observed remote sensing spectra to deduce the spectral-shape of the total absorption coefficient.The forward model is verified using simulated data from the International Ocean Colour Coordinating Group (IOCCG data) and is compared with two existing models.Statistical analysis results of model verification show that the forward model is able to derive Kd values with 3{\%} accuracy (relative mean absolute error). Our solution provides an improvement on the accuracy of the estimated Kd when compared to other models, and especially at larger depths. The inversion scheme is validated against three sets of data: IOCCG, field measured and satellite observed matchups. Field measurements were collected in the turbid Naivasha Lake, Kenya. The mean absolute relative error in the derived Kd in all data sets did not exceed 15{\%}, with the satellite matchup set resulting in the largest discrepancy.The developed model, 2SeaColor, is stable to noise up to 15{\%} and consistently produces accurate results which make it an ideal candidate model for the future Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) on board the Sentinel-3 mission.},

abstract = {The mechanistic model reported in Lee et al. (2015) estimating the Secchi disk depth (ZSD) was applied to an oligo- to mesotrophic reservoir in Brazil. The model was originally validated with data covering lake, oceanic, and coastal waters; however, the model used the quasi-analytical algorithm (QAA) designed for optically deep waters as input and was applied to oceanic and coastal waters to derive absorption [a] and backscattering [bb] coefficients. The hypothesis is that the use of QAAv5 (http://www.ioccg.org/groups/Software{\_}OCA/QAA{\_}v5.pdf) to estimate both a and bb (step M1) to retrieve Kd (step M2) and ZSD (step M3) will lead to errors caused by M1 preventing an accurate estimate in oligo- to mesotrophic water. To test this hypothesis, data collected in three field trips were used to apply the mechanistic model based on the spectral bands from OLI/Landsat-8, (often applied to oceanic and coastal waters), and multispectral instrument (MSI)/Sentinel-2 bands (applied to QAA designed for very turbid inland water). The impact of step M1 over steps M2 and M3 was analyzed by the error analysis. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for Kd using QAAv5 ranged between 10.35{\%} and 19.76{\%}, while the error using QAAM14 varied between 12.68{\%} and 28.29{\%}. Regarding the errors of step M3 and applying QAAv5, the total root-mean-square difference (RMSD) varied from 0.55 to 1.18 m and MAPE ranged between 12.86{\%} and 31.17{\%}, while the RMSD ranged between 0.70 and 1.50 m and MAPE varied from 14.33{\%} to 39.13{\%} when using QAAM14. However, the result from QAAv5 showed a better correlation with in situ data, although underestimating Kd and ZSD. Therefore, a modified version of QAAv5 (QAAR17) was evaluated. The results showed an improvement of Kd (MAPE ranging between 8.89{\%} to 18.76{\%}) and ZSD (RMSD ranging between 0.32 and 0.90 m and MAPE ranging between 8.65 and 19.75{\%}), bringing the values close to the 1:1 line. The largest error was observed for the data of the second field trip, where the bio-optical properties showed a horizontal gradient along the reservoir. In addition, the magnitude of the remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) also varied depending on the water quality. Thus, with respect to ZSD mapping, this research showed that environments with a high variability in Rrs can limit the accurate estimation of inherent optical properties (IOPs) based on QAAv5. Therefore, the limiting step of the model was attributed to M1, which means that the mechanistic model from Lee et al. (2015) can be considered an universal approach if M1 is modified based on the type of water.},

Utilizes QAA model with Landsat 8 along an in-river reservoir on the the Tiete River in Brazil.

Took water-samples between late april and late september and processed to determine optical constituents (Chl-a, TSS, cdom, phytoplankton, and Tripton?).

In situ high spectral measurements taken as well.

Very similar methods to Lee et al 2016.

Good Trend analysis in discussion.


'the current study recommends the use of a broader dataset covering different types of inland water to evaluate different QAA approaches and reach an universal format. Although, eventualmodifications could be necessary based on the sensor configu- ration. Thus, the hypothesis that QAAv5 cannot accurately retrieve IOPs for inlandwaterwas confirmed,which means that stepM1 is the limit- ing factor for ZSD retrieval. However, the results also show that the mechanistic model proposed by Lee et al. (2015) can be considered as universally'

abstract = {AVHRR satellite imagery was evaluated as a potential data source for monitoring light attenuation (K-PAR), as a measure of turbidity, in Pamlico Sound estuary, North Carolina. In situ water quality data and reflectance imagery collected on 10 different dates were used to calibrate a general optical equation relating satellite-derived reflectance (R-d), nominally R-(630 nm) to K-PAR. Additional spectral data (e.g., absorption, subsurface reflectance), related reflectance and K-PAR to changes in phytoplankton pigments, organic matter, and suspended sediments. Optically, Pamlico Sound, North Carolina is dominated by scattering from suspended sediments, whereas the tributary rivers are dominated by absorption from both dissolved and particulate organic matter. A general relationship developed between R-d and K-PAR (r(2)=0.72) in Pamlico Sound was found useful in a variety of environmental conditions; however a relationship between R-d and suspended sediment concentration was less robust, and affected by changing sediment characteristics. In the rivers, high and variable absorption in the visible wavelengths precluded development of a relationship between R-d and K-PAR. The relationship developed between R-d and K-PAR in Pamlico Sound is similar to those determined for Delaware Bay and Mobile Bay in previous studies, suggesting possible broader regional application of algorithms for coastal bays and estuaries having similar sediment characteristics, with direct application to SeaWiFS data.

abstract = {Phycocyanin primarily exists in freshwater cyanobacteria. Accurate estimation of low phycocyanin concentration (PC) is critical for issuing an early warning of potential risks of cyanobacterial population growth to the public. To monitor cyanobacterial biomass in eutrophic inland waters, an approach is proposed to partition non-water absorption coefficient (at-w($\lambda$)) into the contribution of colored dissolved matter (CDM), non-phycocyanin pigments, and phycocyanin with the aim of improving the accuracy in remotely estimated PC, in particular for low PC. The proposed algorithm extends the IOP Inversion Model of Inland Waters (IIMIW) that derives at-w($\lambda$) and chlorophyll-a concentration from remote sensing reflectance. The extended IIMIW retrieves absorption spectra of both CDM (acdm($\lambda$)) and phytoplankton (aph($\lambda$)) with R2≥0.80 and a relative root mean square error (rRMSE)≤31.79{\%} for acdm(412), aph(443), aph(620), and aph(665) when validated with data collected in 2010 from three Indiana reservoirs. In fact, comparison of our algorithm with other partitioning models demonstrates the new algorithm to be more suitable for inland waters. The algorithm also achieved more accurate PC estimation with R2=0.81, rRMSE=33.60{\%}, and mean relative error (RE)=49.11{\%} than the widely used semi-empirical algorithm with R2=0.73, rRMSE=45.09{\%}, and mean RE=182.29{\%} for the same dataset. The validation of our algorithm against the data collected in other years shows that the proposed algorithm worked for a wide range of limnological conditions. In particular, low PC (PC≤50mgm-3) values of for all datasets used in this study were well predicted by the proposed algorithm.},

abstract = {Nuisance blue-green algal blooms contribute to aesthetic degradation of water resources by means of accelerated eutrophication, taste and odor problems, and the production of toxins that can have serious adverse human health effects. Current field-based methods for detecting blooms are costly and time consuming, delaying management decisions. Methods have been developed for estimating phycocyanin concentration, the accessory pigment unique to freshwater blue-green algae, in productive inland water. By employing the known optical properties of phycocyanin, researchers have evaluated the utility of field-collected spectral response patterns for determining concentrations of phycocyanin pigments and ultimately blue-green algal abundance. The purpose of this research was to evaluate field spectroscopy as a rapid cyanobacteria bloom assessment method. In-situ field reflectance spectra were collected at 54 sampling sites on two turbid reservoirs on September 6th and 7th in Indianapolis, Indiana using ASD Fieldspec (UV/VNIR) spectroradiometers. Surface water samples were analyzed for in-vitro pigment concentrations and other physical and chemical water quality parameters. Semi-empirical algorithms by Simis et al. [Simis, S., Peters, S., Gons, H. (2005). Remote sensing of the cyanobacterial pigment phycocyanin in turbid inland water. American Society of Limnology and Oceanography 50(11): 237-245] were applied to the field spectra to predict chlorophyll a and phycocyanin absorption at 665 nm and 620 nm, respectively. For estimation of phycocyanin concentration, a specific absorption coefficient of 0.0070 m2 mg PC-1 for phycocyanin at 620 nm, aPC*(620), was employed, yielding an r2 value of 0.85 (n = 48, p {\textless} 0.0001), mean relative residual value of 0.51 ($\sigma$ = 1.41) and root mean square error (RMSE) of 19.54 ppb. Results suggest this algorithm could be a robust model for estimating phycocyanin. Error is highest in water with phycocyanin concentrations of less than 10 ppb and where phycocyanin abundance is low relative to chlorophyll a. A strong correlation between measured phycocyanin concentrations and biovolume measurements of cyanobacteria was also observed (r = 0.89), while a weaker relationship (r = 0.66) resulted between chlorophyll a concentration and cyanobacterial biovolume. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {A consistent database was established to characterize key environmental factors known to control delta morphology. The database includes the location, basin morphology, fluvial and sediment discharge to the deltas, delta morphology, ocean energy, and shelf depth reached by the sub-aqueous delta. Fifty-one deltas were selected to cover the global parameter range of rivers entering all major oceans and coastal seas. Seasonal satellite images of the deltas were processed (IKONOS, SPOT, LANDSAT, and MODIS). Predictive statistical relationships were obtained, suitable for hypothesis testing or to constrain/verify numerical models used to simulate the evolution of coastal systems. The area of a delta is best predicted from average discharge, the total sediment load feeding the delta, and the offshore accommodation space. The gradient of a delta plain, measured from the apex of the delta to the coast along the main channel, is best predicted with a ratio of sediment supply to sediment retention, sediment concentration used as a proxy of delta plain sedimentation, and mean water discharge. Widths of distributary channels form a lognormal distribution, with the cumulative width of the river mouths directly related to the maximum discharge, tidal and wave energy. The grain size of topset deposits scales with the river length. Hundreds of millions of people occupy deltas and human engineering is now a major influence on the growth and evolution of many deltas, through control of the flow path of distributary channels, and mitigation of the seasonal flood wave with concomitant change in the delivery of sediment load. More and more deltas are moving away from their pre-Anthropocene morphology, as influenced by pristine sediment supply and sediment dispersal. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Since the beginning of the 1960s an escalating deterioration of reed beds in parts of Europe has been often observed. Hence, the 'reed die-back' as it was later named, has been a phenomenon of great scientific interest and concern to conservationists worldwide and intensively studied by field ecologists. Imaging spectroscopy has frequently been employed for vegetation mapping, but this paper is the first explicit analysis of the spectral information content for reed and an assessment of the potential for detecting the areas affected by the reed die-back syndrome using hyperspectral data at the near infrared and the chlorophyll absorption spectral regions. Leaf reflectance spectra and photophysiological information were acquired using a Hand-Held ASD spectroradiometer, a portable fluorometer and a chlorophyll metre in-situ concurrently from leaf samples along a transect perpendicular to the lake shore of Central Europe's largest inland lake in terms of area, Lake Balaton in Hungary. A strong correlation between narrowband spectral indices and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters indicates the potential of hyperspectral remote sensing in assessing plant stability. Canopy hyperspectral data were collected from an airborne AISA Eagle sensor (400-1000nm). An application of the findings from the field data analysis to airborne hyperspectral imagery reveals important information about reed condition at the study area. Y(II) values, regarded as a proxy of photosystem activity, have been calculated from high R2 combination of spectral ratio 612/516 representing Fs and 699/527 representing Fm'. ETR values are estimated based on the calculated Y(II) and the spectral ratio 463/488 for Photosynthetically Active Radiation. This research underpins the development of methods for the spectral discrimination of reed patches affected by stress caused by environmental conditions, and subsequently the reed die-back syndrome. A comparison with empirical vegetation indices from the literature shows significantly higher R2 values of the proposed indices for the specific application. We recommend spectral indices at leaf level for evaluating reed ecological status based on spectroscopic data to support the identification of affected vegetation patches and present R2 maps that can aid the selection of indices tailored to specifications of remote sensors.},

abstract = {Many aquatic ecosystems in the United States and worldwide are impaired by the over-enrichment of waters by nutrients. In advanced stages, the process of eutrophication can cause harmful algae blooms. This research retrieved the concentra- tions of suspended chlorophyll (Chl), suspended minerals (SM), colored dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and turbidity (total attenuation) from AVIRIS imagery of a severely over- enriched waterway in North Carolina, and evaluated if these parameters could be used as indicators of conditions leading to algae blooms. A digital image processing algorithm called QSC1 (Quantitative Shoreline Characterization, Version 1.0) was used. The retrieved water quality parameter values were tested by statistical comparisons to field measurements made at the time of the AVIRIS data collection. Applying QSC1 to AVIRIS imagery resulted in measurements of Chl that corre- lated well with field measurements (r?0.84). Problems with field sampling prevented the assessment of retrieved SM and DOC. The statistical correlation analysis indicated that, for comparison to remotely sensed data, field measurements in the steadily flowing Neuse River must be collected within two hours of the imagery. Thematic maps of each water quality parameter were generated from the imagery and evaluated. The maps of Chl showed spatial patterns consistent with the field data and circulation of the river, and indicated potential point and non-point sources. Statistical and principle compo- nent analyses were used to assess whether the AVIRIS water quality measurements were directly or indirectly related to pa- rameters and conditions indicative of nutrient loading and algae blooms that were measured in the field. The AVIRIS mea- surements were used to create a new index of eutrophication, the Algae Production Potential Index (APPI), for the purpose of mapping where conditions of high nutrient loading and po- tential algae blooms exist. The index uses direct measure- ments of Chl, DOC, and SM (as a surrogate for phosphate). These measurements are combined in a GIS model based on ecological relationships. Although not field verified, the APPI map shows patterns of algae bloom conditions that are simi- lar in size, scale, and location to previous blooms in the Neuse. M.A.},

abstract = {Understanding the factors that affect water quality and the ecological services provided by freshwater ecosystems is an urgent global environmental issue. Predicting how water quality will respond to global changes not only requires water quality data, but also information about the ecological context of individual water bodies across broad spatial extents. Because lake water quality is usually sampled in limited geographic regions, often for limited time periods, assessing the environmental controls of water quality requires compilation of many data sets across broad regions and across time into an integrated database. LAGOS-NE accomplishes this goal for lakes in the northeastern-most 17 US states. LAGOS-NE contains data for 51101 lakes and reservoirs larger than 4 ha in 17 lake-rich US states. The database includes 3 datamodules for: lake location and physical characteristics for all lakes; ecological context (i.e., the land use, geologic, climatic, and hydrologic setting of lakes) for all lakes; and in situmeasurements of lake water quality for a subset of the lakes fromthe past 3 decades for approximately 2600–12 000 lakes depending on the variable. The database contains approximately 150000 measures of total phosphorus, 200 000 measures of chlorophyll, and 900 000 measures of Secchi depth. The water quality data were compiled from87 lake water quality data sets fromfederal, state, tribal, and non-profit agencies, university researchers, and citizen scientists. This database is one of the largest andmost comprehensive databases of its type because it includes both in situmeasurements and ecological context data. Because ecological context can be used to study a variety of other questions about lakes, streams, and wetlands, this database can also be used as the foundation for other studies of freshwaters at broad spatial and ecological scales},

abstract = {Aircraft-mounted hyperspectral spectrometers were used to collect imagery with high spatial and spectral resolution for use in measuring optically active water quality characteristics of major rivers of Minnesota. Ground-based sampling undertaken concurrent with image acquisition provided calibration data for chlorophyll, suspended solids, turbidity and other measures of water clarity. Our approach identified the spectral characteristics that distinguish waters dominated by several inherent optical properties (IOPs), and we used those characteristics to develop models to map water quality characteristics in optically complex waters. For phytoplankton related variables (volatile suspended solids (VSS) and chlorophyll a (chl a)), the ratios of the scattering peak at the red edge ({\~{}}700nm) with the reflectance troughs caused by chlorophyll absorption at {\~{}}670nm and other plant pigment absorption peaks at 592 and 620nm all were strong predictors of chl a and VSS (r2 values of 0.73-0.94). The scattering peak at {\~{}}700nm was a strong predictor of variables related to water clarity (total suspended solids (TSS), turbidity and turbidity tube (T-tube)) (r2 values of 0.77-0.93). For mineral-based variables (nonvolatile suspended solids (NVSS) and the ratio NVSS:TSS), combinations of the TSS and chl a relationships described above were strong predictors (r2 values of 0.73-0.97) and the most robust because this model corrects for the scattering of phytoplankton at {\~{}}700nm. Application of the methods to quantify spatial variations in water quality for stretches of the Mississippi River and its tributaries indicate that hyperspectral imagery can be used to distinguish and map key variables under complex IOP conditions, particularly to separate and map inorganic suspended sediments independently of chlorophyll levels. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Spectral values of absorption of light by dissolved organic matter were measured in samples originating from diverse parts of the ocean, quite different with respect to pigment and par-ticle content. The use of llO-cm cells and then of lo-cm cells, with a highly sensitive spec-trophotometer, allowed measurement throughout the UV-visible range (200-700 nm) even for the low concentrations of yellow substance encountered in the open sea. The concentra-tion appears influenced predominantly by natural and industrial land discharges. In oceanic waters, it remains low and seems to be related to the biological activity averaged over a long period rather than to the local and temporary phytoplankton content. However, even at such low concentrations, yellow substance in the open sea may have an effect on absorption and hence on ocean color similar to that of low or moderate algal biomass. The spectral depen-dence law of absorption appears to vary within a restricted range, and an average law can be considered representative of rapid measurements at one selected wavelength. The increasing absorption of light by filtered natural waters with decreasing wavelength is well known. The dissolved and colloidal organic compounds present in natural waters and responsible for this absorption were collectively called " Gelbstoff' by Kalle (1938), i.e. yellow substance, and more recently " Gilvin " (Kirk 1976). This substance has been subjected to many investigations to determine its ori-gin and chemical composition. Most ab-sorption measurements have been re-stricted to the UV part of the spectrum, where absorption is much higher than in the visible part. However, yellow sub-stance (y .s.), in addition to pigments and nonliving material, is one of the factors determining the shape of the total ab-sorption spectrum in the visible range, and thus causes variations in ocean color (Morel and P rieur 1977). To study the effect of this substance on the optical properties of seawater, for instance for remote sensing applications, we must know its spectral absorption coefficients throughout the visible range.

abstract = {The need for more effective environmental monitoring of the open and coastal ocean has recently led to notable advances in satellite ocean color technology and algorithm research. Satellite ocean color sensors' data are widely used for the detection, mapping and monitoring of phytoplankton blooms because earth observation provides a synoptic view of the ocean, both spatially and temporally. Algal blooms are indicators of marine ecosystem health; thus, their monitoring is a key component of effective management of coastal and oceanic resources. Since the late 1970s, a wide variety of operational ocean color satellite sensors and algorithms have been developed. The comprehensive review presented in this article captures the details of the progress and discusses the advantages and limitations of the algorithms used with the multi-spectral ocean color sensors CZCS, SeaWiFS, MODIS and MERIS. Present challenges include overcoming the severe limitation of these algorithms in coastal waters and refining detection limits in various oceanic and coastal environments. To understand the spatio-temporal patterns of algal blooms and their triggering factors, it is essential to consider the possible effects of environmental parameters, such as water temperature, turbidity, solar radiation and bathymetry. Hence, this review will also discuss the use of statistical techniques and additional datasets derived from ecosystem models or other satellite sensors to characterize further the factors triggering or limiting the development of algal blooms in coastal and open ocean waters. {\textcopyright} 2014.},

abstract = {High concentrations of suspended particulate matter in coastal waters directly affect or govern numerous water column and benthic processes. The concentration of suspended sediments derived from bottom sediment resuspension or discharge of sediment-laden rivers is highly variable over a wide range of time and space scales. Although there has been considerable effort to use remotely sensed images to provide synoptic maps of suspended particulate matter, there are limited routine applications of this technology due in part to the low spatial resolution, long revisit period, or cost of most remotely sensed data. In contrast, near daily coverage of medium-resolution data is available from the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Terra instrument without charge from several data distribution gateways. Equally important, several display and processing programs are available that operate on low cost computers.The utility of MODIS 250 m data for analyzing complex coastal waters was examined in the Northern Gulf of Mexico. Using simple processing procedures, MODIS images were used to map the concentration of Total Suspended Matter (TSM). A robust linear relationship was established between band 1 (620-670 nm) MODIS Terra 250 m data and in situ measurements of TSM (r 2=0.89; n=52; MSE=4.74) acquired during six field campaigns. This study demonstrates that the moderately high resolution of MODIS 250 m data and the operating characteristics of the instrument provide data useful for examining the transport and fate of materials in coastal environments, particularly smaller bodies of water such as bays and estuaries. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The launch of several new satellites such as Sentinel-2, Sentinel-3, HyspIRI, EnMAP and PRISMA in the very near future, opens new perspectives for the inland and coastal water community. The monitoring of the water quality closer to the coast, within estuaries or small lakes with satellite data will become feasible. However for these inland and nearshore coastal waters, adjacency effects may hamper the correct retrieval of water quality parameters from remotely sensed imagery. Here, we present a sensor-generic adjacency pre-processing method, SIMilarity Environment Correction (SIMEC). The correction algorithm estimates the contribution of the background radiance based on the correspondence with the Near-INfrared (NIR) similarity spectrum. The performance of SIMEC was tested on MERIS FR images both above highly reflecting waters with high SPM loads, as well as dark lake waters with high CDOM absorption. The results show that SIMEC has a positive or neutral effect on the normalized remote sensing reflectance above optically-complex waters, retrieved with the MERIS MEGS or C2R processor.},

abstract = {Land use impacts are commonly quantified and compared using 2D maps, limiting the scale of their reported impacts to surface area estimates. Yet, nearly all land use involves disturbances below the land surface. Incorporating this third dimension into our estimates of land use impact is especially important when examining the impacts of mining. Mountaintop mining is the most common form of coal mining in the Central Appalachian ecoregion. Previous estimates suggest that active, reclaimed, or abandoned mountaintop mines cover approximately 7{\%} of Central Appalachia. While this is double the areal extent of development in the ecoregion (estimated to occupy {\textless}3{\%} of the land area), the impacts are far more extensive than areal estimates alone can convey as the impacts of mines extend 10s to 100s of meters below the current land surface. Here, we provide the first estimates for the total volumetric and topographic disturbance associated with mining in an 11500 km(2) region of southern West Virginia. We find that the cutting of ridges and filling of valleys has lowered the median slope of mined landscapes in the region by nearly 10 degrees while increasing their average elevation by 3 m as a result of expansive valley filling. We estimate that in southern West Virginia, more than 6.4km(3) of bedrock has been broken apart and deposited into 1544 headwater valley fills. We used NPDES monitoring datatsets available for 91 of these valley fills to explore whether fill characteristics could explain variation in the pH or selenium concentrations reported for streams draining these fills. We found that the volume of overburden in individual valley fills correlates with stream pH and selenium concentration, and suggest that a three-dimensional assessment of mountaintop mining impacts is necessary to predict both the severity and the longevity of the resulting environmental impacts.},

abstract = {Observations of the Gulf Stream System in the Gulf of Mexico were obtained in synchronization with LANDSAT-1. Computer enhanced images, which are necessary to extract useful oceanic information, show that the current can be observed by color (diffuse radiance) or sea state (specular radiance) effects associated with the cyclonic boundary even in the absence of a surface thermal signature. The color effect relates to the spectral variations in the optical properties of the water and its suspended particles, and is studied by radiative transfer theory. Significant oceanic parameters identified are: the probability of forward scattering, and the ratio of scattering to total attenuation. Several spectra of upwelling diffuse light are computed as a function of the concentration of particles and yellow substance. These calculations compare favorably with experimental measurements and show that the ratio of channels method gives ambiguous interpretative results. The results are used to discuss features in images where surface measurements were obtained and are extended to tentative explanation in others. {\textcopyright} 1976.},

abstract = {The little-known lacustrine ecosystem of Ibera wetland was examined using satellite-measured reflectance to determine several limnological variables (Secchi depth, Sd; nephelometric turbidity, Tn; dissolved organic matter, DOM). The spatial and temporal analysis has shown the main relationships between the local forcing factors and the ecological state of the aquatic ecosystems. The spatial geomorphologic characteristics of the wetland were strongly related to the spatial distribution of the limnological variables. According to this, the macrosystem has been classified into three large regions that enclose lakes that share diverse characteristics. (i) Northwestern region encloses few open water areas, mainly of small size. (ii) Rounded large lakes (probably originated as oxbow floodplain lakes) are characteristics of the Northeastern region. (iii) Elongated large lakes (probably originated as levee floodplain lakes) are characteristics of the Southern region. These lakes showed the highest Sd and DOM values and the lowest Tn. The different water drainage of the regions seems to be the main cause of the limnological differences of the wetland. The described spatial classification agrees also with other ecological characteristics such as the degree of macrophytes development or composition of the fish community. Different disturbed local areas, overlapping the regional classification, were also identified in the borders of the wetland. These areas have been related with the presence of anthropogenic activities, revealing the sensitivity of these shallow lakes. The whole system showed a relatively homogenous seasonal pattern of water transparency related with solar irradiance cycle. The variability of active floodplains lakes of the Upper Paran{\'{a}} was found to be more strongly influenced by the rainfall, presenting a more unpredictable behaviour. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

This paper com- prehensively evaluates the quantification of four types of water quality parameters: inorganic sediment particles, phytoplankton pigments, coloured dissolved organic material and Secchi disk depth. It concentrates on quantification requirements, as well as the options in selecting the most appropriate sensor data for the purpose. Relevant factors, such as quantification imple- mentation and validation of the quantified results are also extensively discussed. This review reveals that the relationship between in situ samples and their corresponding remotely sensed data can be linear or nonlinear, but are nearly always site-specific. The quantification has been attempted from terrestrial satellite data largely for suspended sediments and chlorophyll con- centrations. The quantification has been implemented through integration of remotely sensed imagery data, in situ water samples and ancillary data in a geographic information system (GIS). The introduction of GIS makes the quantification feasible for more variables at an increasingly higher accuracy. Affected by the number and quality of in situ samples, accuracy of quantifica- tion has been reported in different ways and varies widely},

abstract = {Remotely sensed assessment of dredging impacts on water turbidity is straightforward when turbidity plumes show up in clear water. However, it is more complicated in turbid waters as the spatial or temporal changes in turbidity might be of natural origin. The plausibility of attributing turbidity patterns to dredging activities would be greatly enhanced when demonstrating association between dredging infrastructure and water turbidity. This study investigated the possibility to strengthen the inference of dredging impact while simultaneously monitoring vessels and water turbidity in the northern Poyang Lake, China, where dredging was first introduced in 2001 and rapidly extended onwards. Time-series of Landsat TM and MODIS images of 2000-2005 were used to estimate the distribution and number of vessels as well as water turbidity. MODIS images revealed a significant increase in water turbidity from 2001 onwards. Landsat TM image analysis indicated a simultaneous increase in the number of vessels. Regression analysis further showed a highly significant positive relationship (R2=0.92) between water turbidity and vessel number. Visual interpretation of ship locations led to the conclusion that clear upstream waters developed turbidity plumes while passing the first cluster of vessels. We concluded that dredging caused the increase in water turbidity, and simultaneously monitoring the water turbidity and vessels enhanced the strength of evidence in remotely sensed dredging impact assessment. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Turbidity and chlorophyll introduce high uncertainty in remote sensing of Chromophoric Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM) in riverine and coastal water. To reduce the uncertainty, we developed a functional linear model (FLM) to analyze spectral responses to CDOM concentrations observed in a cruise along two rivers and a tidal bay. The analysis was supported with the measurement of high spatial resolution underwater CDOM concentrations and concurrent in situ above-surface hyperspectral remote sensing reflectance. The functional linear model is able to explain up to 91percent of CDOM observations (R2   0.91, RMSE   0.0206). The dummy variables of local environmental factors included in the estimation improve CDOM assessment in coastal water. Our analysis suggests that the pattern changes of the FLM coefficient curves provide useful information for understanding the spectral signal interference from turbidity and chlorophyll.

abstract = {The sediment load delivered from the Huanghe (Yellow River) to the sea has decreased sharply to 0.15 × 109 metric tons per year (0.15 Gt/yr) between 2000 and 2005, and now represents only 14{\%} of the widely cited estimate of 1.08 Gt/yr. The river seems to be reverting to the pristine levels characteristic of the middle Holocene, prior to human intervention. Datasets from 1950 to 2005 from four key gauging stations in the main stream reveal distinct stepwise decreases in sediment load, which are attributed to both natural and anthropogenic impacts over the past 56 yr. Completions of two reservoirs, Liujiaxia (1968) and Longyangxia (1985), in the upper reaches of the river and their joint operations have resulted in stepwise decreases in sediment load coming from the upper reaches. Effective soil conservation practices in the middle reaches since the late 1970s, combined with the operation of the Sanmenxia and Xiaolangdi reservoirs, have also caused stepwise decreases in sediment load at Huayuankou in the middle reaches, but the decrease differs from that observed in the upper reaches. Decrease in precipitation is responsible for 30{\%} of the decrease in sediment load at Huayuankou, while the remaining 70{\%} is ascribed to human activities in the river basin, of which soil conservation practices contribute 40{\%} to the total decrease. Sediment retention within reservoirs accounts for 20{\%} of the total sediment load decrease, although there was notable sediment retention within the Xiaolangdi reservoir from 2000 to 2005. The remaining 10{\%} of the decrease in sediment load is a result of the operation of reservoirs in the upper reaches. In the lower reaches, 20{\%} of the sediment passing Huayuankou has been lost as a result of channel deposition and water abstraction. Soil conservation practices and the operation of reservoirs have lowered the content of coarser sediment (D {\textgreater} 0.05 mm) at Huayuankou, and reduced channel deposition in the lower reaches. In contrast, sediment loss owing to water abstraction in the lower reaches has increased considerably as water consumption for agricultural needs has increased. Therefore, the combined effects of climate change and human activities in the upper, middle, and lower reaches have resulted in stepwise decreases in the sediment load delivered from the Huanghe to the sea. The Huanghe provides an excellent example of the altered river systems impacted by climate change and extensive human activities over the past 56 yr. Further dramatic decreases in sediment load and water discharge in the Huanghe will trigger profound geological, morphological, ecological, and biogeochemical responses in the estuary, delta, and coastal sea. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The potential of imaging spectroscopy for Earth remote sensing has been demonstrated since the 1980s. However, most of the developments and applications in imaging spectroscopy have largely relied on airborne spectrometers, as the amount and quality of space-based imaging spectroscopy data remain relatively low to date. The upcoming Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP) German imaging spectroscopy mission is intended to fill this gap. An overview of the main characteristics and current status of the mission is provided in this contribution. The core payload of EnMAP consists of a dual-spectrometer instrument measuring in the optical spectral range between 420 and 2450 nm with a spectral sampling distance varying between 5 and 12 nm and a reference signal-to-noise ratio of 400:1 in the visible and near-infrared and 180:1 in the shortwave-infrared parts of the spectrum. EnMAP images will cover a 30 km-wide area in the across-track direction with a ground sampling distance of 30 m. An across-track tilted observation capability will enable a target revisit time of up to four days at the Equator and better at high latitudes. EnMAP will contribute to the development and exploitation of spaceborne imaging spectroscopy applications by making high-quality data freely available to scientific users worldwide.},

@article{Brezonik2015,
abstract = {A combination of new measurements and analysis of historical data from several geographic regions was used to address four issues that affect the reliability and interpretation of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) measured by remote sensing of inland waters. First, high variability of CDOM levels in lakes and rivers was found at seasonal and multi-year time scales and at shorter intervals in some rivers and lakes. Coefficients of variation (CVs) of 30{\%}-50{\%} for absorptivity at 440nm (a440) were common in historical and new data sets we examined. CDOM values used to calibrate imagery thus should be measured close to the image acquisition date, preferably within 1-2 months in lakes and a few days in large rivers, unless it can be shown that CDOM levels are temporally stable over longer (or shorter) time periods in a given aquatic system. Second, spectral slopes (S) for CDOM in the visible range vary little over time (even over multi-year periods) within sites. Substantial variation was found between sites, however, and most spectra showed a change in slope near 460nm. Values of S400-460 for waters with moderate to high CDOM levels generally were within a narrow range ({\~{}}0.014-0.018) and similar to reported S values in the near UV. Values of S400-460 for waters with low CDOM generally were smaller and more variable, as were values for S460-650 for all waters. Overall, the variability of spectral slopes in the visible range should not have a large effect on the reliability of a440 estimates made from remote sensing, which in many models involve reflectance measurements at wavelengths{\textgreater}500nm. Third, although a strong correlation (r2=0.925) was found between CDOM levels and DOC concentrations in 34 surface waters sampled in 2013, the standard error of estimate suggests an uncertainty of{\~{}}±20{\%} in predicting DOC at a440=5m-1 (a moderate CDOM level). Moreover, CDOM-DOC relationships for unpublished data sets we analyzed and those reported in the literature indicate that both the fraction of DOC that is colored and slopes of regressions between CDOM and DOC are highly variable in space and time. Prediction of DOC concentrations in water bodies from CDOM levels (whether measured in the laboratory or by remote sensing) thus is associated with considerable uncertainty. For the present, this implies that field sampling is required to verify DOC concentrations predicted from remotely sensed CDOM measurements until we have a better understanding of variations in DOC-CDOM relationships. Fourth, shapes of reflectance spectra for CDOM-rich waters varied greatly depending on the concentrations of other constituents (suspended solids and chlorophyll) that affect the optical properties of water. Nonetheless, it is not obvious from our results for several predictive models that different remote sensing algorithms are needed to calculate CDOM levels accurately for waters where CDOM is the only variable affecting reflectance versus waters where other constituents also affect the spectra. The best band or band ratio models for simulated Landsat 8, Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 bands from field measured reflectance spectra yielded high r2 values (0.84-0.86) for a440. The broader Landsat 8 bands worked nearly as well for a440 as the narrower Sentinel band sets and hyperspectral bands, probably because CDOM is characterized by a broad exponential increase in absorbance with decreasing wavelength rather than specific peaks or troughs in absorbance or reflectance.},

Flood simulations were output and summarized for the periods 1912–1950 (before dams were constructed on the river) and 1965–1996 (after all of the dams were completed). Tenth percentile (dry), median, and 90th percentile (wet) hydroperiod(flood duration) regimeswere generated for the spring and year, both pre- and post-dam.Detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) was used to ordinate the plot data, and correlation/regression between ordination axis scores and the flood variableswere used to explore the relationships between flooding and species composition. Nineteenth percentile hydroperiod (i.e., wet conditions) correlated most strongly with DCA axis 1 (r {\textgreater} 0.9), indicating that inundation during extremely wet years strongly controls species composition on the floodplain. The results were used to quantitatively determine the niche width for both species and mapped vegetation classes in terms of number of days flooded annually and during the spring growth period. The results suggest that spring hydroperiod is an important mechanism that may drive competitive sorting along the flooding gradient, especially during the early years of succession (i.e., pre-dam, which represents the period during which most of the forests sampledwere established), and that annual hydroperiod affects the relative dominance of species as the forests mature.},

abstract = {Landsat-MSS satellite data and corresponding water quality measurements of suspended sediment concentration for Lake Chicot, Arkansas, were used to evaluate several possible models for the relation between these two data types. Satellite data were converted to physical values of radiance and reflectance using both the NASA standard curve and the spectrum recommended by the World Radiation Center. Incorporation of an orbital eccentricity correction factor into the computation of solar spectral irradiance was also tested. Results of the analyses, which involved 310 observations suggest that a theoretically-derived expontential curve best characterizes the relation between exo-atmospheric reflectance and suspended sediment concentration. Based on the strength of the model relations and the range of data tested, it is concluded that temporal and spatial variability in the concentration of suspended sediments within lakes and reservoirs can be inventoried and monitored from space-based sensor systems.},

abstract = {Amazon floodplain lakes range widely in concentrations of optically active constituents (OAC) driven by seasonality in hydrological and biogeochemical processes, but in general they are characterized by high turbidity (NTU from 90 to 1645) compared to coastal waters. In this work, instruments for measuring inherent optical properties (IOPs) of water bodies were evaluated for the first time in floodplain lakes in the lower Amazon River during the falling limb of the hydrograph. Water column profiles of total attenuation and absorption were measured using the Spectral Absorption and Attenuation Meter (AC-S-WETLabs), and of backscattering using Hydroscat. These measurements, however, are subject to uncertainties and require corrections for turbid waters. In this paper, we assessed the implications of scattering correction methods for the absorption tube, proposed by the AC-S manufacturer, in the simulation of the Remote Sensing Reflectance (Rrs). The closure experiment comparing Hydrolight (Mobley {\&} Sundman, 2001) simulated Rrs and in situ Rrs demonstrated that neither of the corrections was able to thoroughly account for the scattering errors which were propagated to the absorption measurements with AC-S and backscattering with Hydroscat. The three scattering correction methods (Flat, Proportional and "Kirk") either under or overestimated the absorption coefficient that resulted in either under or overestimation of the simulated Rrs. Flat and Proportional Methods resulted in an underestimation of Rrs from 400 to 550nm and overestimation from 600 to 700nm, indicating that the assumption of zero (0) absorption in the near infrared does not apply to inland turbid water. The Rrs errors varied also according to water OAC composition. Overall, "Kirk" correction method provided the best results regarding the spectral shape of the Rrs, however, failed to account for magnitude. Based on the tuning tests, the errors in spectra magnitude seem to be sensitive to the constant fraction of scattering (CFS) used in the Kirk method. Tests carried out with CFS values varying from 0.18 to 0.38 indicated that magnitude error can be partially overcomed by tuning CFS according to water composition. Improvements in the scattering correction methods are required in order to obtain reliable IOPs in turbid inland Amazon lakes.},

abstract = {Land-ocean transfer of sediment by rivers is a key pathway for material transfer on Earth. Contemporary data on the sediment loads of rivers provide clear evidence of significant recent changes in the sediment fluxes of several rivers in response to human impact. The key drivers of increased sediment loads include land clearance for agriculture and other facets of land surface disturbance, including logging activity and mining. Although, programmes for soil conservation and sediment control can result in reduced sediment loads, the trapping of sediment by dams represents the dominant cause of reduced loads. This influence is currently assuming increasing importance at the global scale. Any attempt to link these drivers to changes in the global land-ocean sediment flux must take account of the aggregation and buffering effects that operate in larger basins, which can cause damping and even removal of signals of increasing flux within the upstream basin, and complicate the link between upstream and downstream response to human impact. Further work is required to provide a precise quantitative assessment of the human impact on global land-ocean sediment fluxes and the net effect of increasing and decreasing fluxes. Particular attention must be paid to the temporal perspective and the variation of impact trajectories in different areas of the globe and for river basins of different sizes. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Reflectivities at each of 170 individual channels between 400 and 900 nm, as well as the relationship between the integral of reflectance and the suspended sediment concentrations (SSC), were analysed. The results showed that as SSC increased, the reflectance from the finer soil increased faster than that from the coarser soil. The overall correlation between SSC and reflectance for the finer soil was higher than the one for the coarser soil. As SSC increased, the peak-reflectance wavelength of both sediments shifted toward longer wavelengths. The coarser soil suffered an early shift at 250 mg l(-1), while the finer soil experienced the shift later at 500 mg l(-1). Finally, the integral of reflectance at 800-900 Mn interval was found to be useful for the estimation of SSC.},

abstract = {The Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) scan line corrector (SLC) failed on May 31, 2003, causing the scanning pattern to exhibit wedge-shaped scan-to-scan gaps. The ETM+ has continued to acquire data with the SLC powered off, leading to images that are missing approximately 22 percent of the normal scene area. To improve the utility of the SLC-off data, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) developed new products that use the data from multiple ETM+ scenes to provide complete ground coverage. These gap-filled products were developed and deployed in two phases. The gaps in the Phase I products are filled with data from imagery collected previously with a functional SLC (SLC-on). A single SLC-on scene provides complete coverage of the scan gaps, making the gap- filling procedure straightforward. Several radiometric adjustment techniques for matching the SLC-on fill scene to the SLC-off primary scene were evaluated for performance, processing speed, and ease of implementation. A simple local histogram matching method was adopted as a result of this evaluation. The Phase II products use data from multiple SLC-off scenes to fill the scan gaps with more recent data. Because the locations of the scan gaps are different for each SLC-off scene, the gap-filling process must account for scan gap interactions. The Phase II product development included a more comprehensive study of candidate radiometric adjustment techniques. This study showed that the histogram matching method used in Phase I, with minor refinements, provided the best overall performance and was adopted for Phase II as well.},

abstract = {Combining water-quality data from multiple sources can help counterbalance diminishing resources for stream monitoring in the United States and lead to important regional and national insights that would not otherwise be possible. Individual monitoring organizations understand their own data very well, but issues can arise when their data are combined with data from other organizations that have used different methods for reporting the same common metadata elements. Such use of multi-source data is termed “secondary use”—the use of data beyond the original intent determined by the organization that collected the data. In this study, we surveyed more than 25 million nutrient records collected by 488 organizations in the United States since 1899 to identify major inconsistencies in metadata elements that limit the secondary use of multi-source data. Nearly 14.5 million of these records had missing or ambiguous information for one or more key metadata elements, including (in decreasing order of records affected) sample fraction, chemical form, parameter name, units of measurement, precise numerical value, and remark codes. As a result, metadata harmonization to make secondary use of these multi-source data will be time consuming, expensive, and inexact. Different data users may make different assumptions about the same ambiguous data, potentially resulting in different conclusions about important environmental issues. The value of these ambiguous data is estimated at {\$}US12 billion, a substantial collective investment by water-resource organizations in the United States. By comparison, the value of unambiguous data is estimated at {\$}US8.2 billion. The ambiguous data could be preserved for uses beyond the original intent by developing and implementing standardized metadata practices for future and legacy water-quality data throughout the United States.},

Approximately 90{\%} of land area and 80{\%} of water export were included, which enabled a continental-scale estimate using minor extrapolation. Total carbon export was 41-49 Tg C yr(-1). IC was {\textgreater}75{\%} of export and exceeded OC export in every region except the southeastern Atlantic seaboard. The 10 largest rivers, by discharge, accounted for 66{\%} of water export and carried 74 and 62{\%} of IC and OC export, respectively. Watershed carbon yield for the conterminous United States was 4.2 and 1.3 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for IC and OC, respectively. The dominance of IC export was unexpected but is consistent with geologic models suggesting high weathering rates in the continental United States due to the prevalence of easily weathered sedimentary rock.},

In spring 2011 a record-breaking flood brought discharge on the lower Mississippi River to dangerous levels, forcing managers to divert up to 3,500 m(3) s(-1) of water to the Atchafalaya River Basin(5). Here we use field-calibrated satellite data to quantify differences in inundation and sediment-plume patterns between the Mississippi and Atchafalaya River. We assess the impact of these extreme outflows on wetland sedimentation, and use in situ data collected during the historic flood to characterize the Mississippi plume's hydrodynamics and suspended sediment. We show that a focused, high-momentum jet emerged from the leveed Mississippi, and delivered sediment far offshore. In contrast, the plume from the Atchafalaya was more diffuse; diverted water inundated a large area, and sediment was trapped within the coastal current. The largest sedimentation, of up to several centimetres, occurred in the Atchafalaya Basin despite the larger sediment load carried by the Mississippi. Sediment accumulation was lowest along the shoreline between the two river sources. We conclude that river-mouth hydrodynamics and wetland sedimentation patterns are mechanistically linked, providing results that are relevant for plans to restore deltaic wetlands using artificial diversions(2-4,6-8).},

abstract = {Water pollution such as green algae blooms and eutrophication in freshwater fatally influences both water quality and human society. Water quality issues in the 4 major rivers in Korea, including the Nakdong, have recently become a major concern. For this reason, it is essential to monitor water quality parameters (WQPs) that have a widespread characteristic to ensure maintenance of an effective water management system. The possibility of utilizing remote sensing technology for monitoring water quality on a regional scale has been recently investigated. The main objective of this study is to evaluate potential applications of the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) for estimating water quality in the Nakdong River, Korea. Correlations between Landsat 8 bands and in situ measurements are determined, and water quality models are established for estimating suspended solids (SS), total nitrogen (TN), chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), and total phosphorus (TP). The results demonstrate that WQPs correlated well with band reflectance values from Landsat 8. Band 5 was reasonably correlated with all WQPs, particularly with SS (R = -0.74) and Chl-a (R = -0.71). This study constructed multiple regression equations for WQPs based on correlation analysis through band combination and band ratio. The spatial distribution of WQPs in the Nakdong River on October 27, 2013 and May 16, 2014 indicate that the river was nearly eutrophic from human activities. Based on the results, the Landsat 8 OLI may be an appropriate data for estimating and monitoring water quality parameters on a regional scale. However, further validation is required to support the findings of this study.},

abstract = {The water quality parameters turbidity and algal pigment concentration of freshwater lakes have been modeled and predicted using Landsat multispectral scanner data as multiple linear predictors. Satellite data for an area in South East Australia from seven occasions during 1978 and 1979 were used along with concurrent ground-based measurements from sampling sites on three lakes covering a wide range of water quality regimes. Date-independent models for turbidity and algal pigment were obtained using the satellite multispectral data and the water quality data from up to 21 sampling sites on one lake on six occasions. The sun elevation at the time of satellite overpass was included in the models to account for differences between dates, and the time of sample collection was included to compensate for diurnal variations in pigment fluorescence. These models were used to successfully predict these water quality parameters for this lake on a new occasion and for the two other lakes on three occasions.},

abstract = {Remotely sensed data can reinforce the abilities of water resources researchers and decision makers to monitor waterbodies more effectively. Remote sensing techniques have been widely used to measure the qualitative parameters of waterbodies (i.e., suspended sediments, colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), chlorophyll-a, and pollutants). A large number of different sensors on board various satellites and other platforms, such as airplanes, are currently used to measure the amount of radiation at different wavelengths reflected from the water's surface. In this review paper, various properties (spectral, spatial and temporal, etc.) of the more commonly employed spaceborne and airborne sensors are tabulated to be used as a sensor selection guide. Furthermore, this paper investigates the commonly used approaches and sensors employed in evaluating and quantifying the eleven water quality parameters. The parameters include: chlorophyll-a (chl-a), colored dissolved organic matters (CDOM), Secchi disk depth (SDD), turbidity, total suspended sediments (TSS), water temperature (WT), total phosphorus (TP), sea surface salinity (SSS), dissolved oxygen (DO), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD).},

abstract = {Relationships between phytoplankton abundance, concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and reflectance spectra were investigated in eight reservoirs of the Colorado Front Range. The purposes of the study were: (1) to determine the degree to which chlorophyll and DOC could be determined from spectral data of the type that can be acquired through remote sensing; and (2) to determine whether equations developed for other waters are applicable to Colorado reservoirs. Supplementary information was obtained from water selectively enriched in dissolved organic carbon (Georgia blackwater lakes) and in phytoplankton (phytoplankton cultures). Reflectance for the lakes ranged from 1 to 5 per cent across the spectrum. All lakes showed a peak of reflectance near 570 nm (green range) corresponding to the minimum absorption for chlorophyll. For both the reservoirs and the phytoplankton cultures, a peak near the red-infrared boundary (ca 700 nm) increased in size and shifted toward longer wavelengths with increasing concentration of chlorophyll a. Georgia blackwater lakes dominated by DOC yielded flat spectra combined with low overall reflectance (usually below 1 per cent). With the presence of tripton in addition to DOC, reflectance was higher and showed peaks near 710 and 810 nm caused by selective scattering and absorption. For the eight reservoirs, chlorophyll showed a very close relationship to ratios of reflectance at a number of wavelengths. The strongest relationship was for the ratio of reflectance in the near-infrared to reflectance in the green spectral range (r(2)=0.98): Chlorophyll a, mu g l(-1)=407 (R(806)/R(571))(2.52). Single ratios of reflectance did not show such strong relationships with concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (r(2) {\textless}0.70). Concentrations of DOC were related strongly, however, to dual ratios that were identified through multiple regression analysis. The closest relationship was (r(2)=0.95): DOC, mgl(-1)=0.55 [(R(716)/R(670))(-9.60)][(R(706)/R(670))(12.94)]. Reflectance ratios of red to green wavelengths and ratios containing reflectance near 800 nm work well for predictions of chlorophyll in Colorado reservoirs, although equations of this type have not been previously reported in the literature. Equations that have been developed for other areas do not consistently fit the data for Colorado reservoirs. Spectral analysis of reflectance in relation to water quality will be required from numerous geographic regions before universal equations or universal typologies can be considered.},

abstract = {A procedure that uses Landsat imagery to estimate Secchi disk transparency (SDT) of lakes was developed and applied to ∼500 lakes with surface areas {\textgreater}10ha in the seven-county metropolitan area of Minneapolis and St. Paul, MN, USA, to assess spatial patterns and temporal trends in lake clarity. Thirteen Landsat MSS and TM images over the period 1973-1998 were used for the analysis. Satellite brightness values from lake surfaces were calibrated against available historical data on SDT (n=∼20-40) measured nearly contemporaneously with the acquisition date of each image. Calibration regression equations for the late-summer TM images had a range of r2 from 0.72 to 0.93. Regression analysis for three late-summer MSS images yielded r2 values ranging from 0.60 to 0.79. Results indicate that a single late-summer image yields a reliable estimate of regional lake clarity and reasonably accurate estimates of SDT for individual lakes. An analysis of seasonal patterns on a large lake water-quality database was used to develop a model that adjusts synoptic satellite SDT estimates from different dates to a common reference, making them more comparable from year-to-year. Analysis of long-term trends shows that in spite of the large land-use changes within the region over the study period, only 49 (about 10{\%}) of assessed lakes in the region showed significant temporal trends in SDT over the period, and more lakes had increasing SDT (34) than decreasing SDT (15). {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {In this article, a methodology for evaluating the effect of land use/land cover on the quality of nearby stream water in a semiarid environment is described and tested on a large watershed in Southeastern Brazil. The approach aims at identifying the width of the riparian area having the strongest effect on different water quality parameters. The land use/land cover data were generated from remotely sensed data while water quality point data were supplied by a government agency. Testing was conducted for both the rainy and dry seasons in an effort to understand the direct effect of surface runoff. The approach combines cartographic modelling using a geographical information system (GIS) and statistics to establish the strength of the relationship between water quality, land use and the distance from the stream. Results suggest a strong relationship between land use/land cover and turbidity, nitrogen and fecal coliforms. They also suggest that each of these parameters has a unique behavior when distance from the stream is considered. Finally, although it was expected that the models would apply better during the wet season, some parameters had the opposite behavior and displayed a better fit during the dry season. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Accurate assessment of phytoplankton chlorophyll-a (chla) concentrations in turbid waters by means of remote sensing is challenging due to the optical complexity of case 2 waters. We have applied a recently developed model of the form [Rrs- 1($\lambda$1) - Rrs- 1($\lambda$2)] × Rrs($\lambda$3) where Rrs($\lambda$i) is the remote-sensing reflectance at the wavelength $\lambda$i, for the estimation of chla concentrations in turbid waters. The objectives of this paper are (a) to validate the three-band model as well as its special case, the two-band model Rrs- 1($\lambda$1) × Rrs($\lambda$3), using datasets collected over a considerable range of optical properties, trophic status, and geographical locations in turbid lakes, reservoirs, estuaries, and coastal waters, and (b) to evaluate the extent to which the three-band model could be applied to the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) and two-band model could be applied to the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to estimate chla in turbid waters. The three-band model was calibrated and validated using three MERIS spectral bands (660-670 nm, 703.75-713.75 nm, and 750-757.5 nm), and the 2-band model was tested using two MODIS spectral bands ($\lambda$1= 662-672, $\lambda$3= 743-753 nm). We assessed the accuracy of chla prediction in four independent datasets without re-parameterization (adjustment of the coefficients) after initial calibration elsewhere. Although the validation data set contained widely variable chla (1.2 to 236 mg m- 3), Secchi disk depth (0.18 to 4.1 m), and turbidity (1.3 to 78 NTU), chla predicted by the three-band algorithm was strongly correlated with observed chla (r2{\textgreater} 0.96), with a precision of 32{\%} and average bias across data sets of - 4.9{\%} to 11{\%}. Chla predicted by the two-band algorithm was also closely correlated with observed chla (r2{\textgreater} 0.92); however, the precision declined to 57{\%}, and average bias across the data sets was 18{\%} to 50.3{\%}. These findings imply that, provided that an atmospheric correction scheme for the red and NIR bands is available, the extensive database of MERIS and MODIS imagery could be used for quantitative monitoring of chla in turbid waters. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The potential of high-resolution IKONOS and QuickBird satellite imagery for mapping and analysis of land and water resources at local scales in Minnesota is assessed in a series of three applications. The applications and accuracies evaluated include: (1) classification of lake water clarity (r2=0.89), (2) mapping of urban impervious surface area (r2=0.98), and (3) aquatic vegetation surveys of emergent and submergent plant groups (80{\%} accuracy). There were several notable findings from these applications. For example, modeling and estimation approaches developed for Landsat TM data for continuous variables such as lake water clarity and impervious surface area can be applied to high-resolution satellite data. The rapid delivery of spatial data can be coupled with current GPS and field computer technologies to bring the imagery into the field for cover type validation. We also found several limitations in working with this data type. For example, shadows can influence feature classification and their effects need to be evaluated. Nevertheless, high-resolution satellite data has excellent potential to extend satellite remote sensing beyond what has been possible with aerial photography and Landsat data, and should be of interest to resource managers as a way to create timely and reliable assessments of land and water resources at a local scale.},

abstract = {The isolated skin of the toad Bufo marinus ictericus when impaled from the outer surface by glass microelectrodes filled with 3 M KCl shows a voltage profile which is a continuous function of the depth of impalement. The superficial intraepithelial potential difference measured with reference to the external solution (PDi) is negative with NaCl-Ringer's solution on both sides of the skin, displaying a minimum of -26.7+/-3.6 mV at 6+/-2 mum. Null value is obtained at 19+/-3 mum, with positive values for deeper impalements. Indications of cell impalements (abrupt voltage and resistance jumps) were frequently observed at sites deeper than 25 mum from the outer surface. Measurements of the electrical resistance between the microelectrode and the external solution, made with single- and double-barreled microelectrodes, showed great discrepancies, which may be attributed to distinct pathways of different resistances in the stratum corneum. PDi measured at a depth of 5 mum was a logarithmic function of Na2SO4 or K2SO4 concentration in the external solution, increasing in negativity with a reduction in concentration. Substitution of Na by K in the external solution had only minor effects on PDi. Acidification of the external solution from pH 9 is accompanied by a reduction in the negative value of PDi. At pH 3 PDi was positive. PDi was interpreted as a diffusion potential at the tip of the microelectrode due to KCl diffusion from the electrode into the matrix of the stratum corneum. Differences in K and Cl mobilities, responsible for the origin of PDi, were attributed to fixed charges in the matrix of the stratum corneum, with density and polarity determined by their degree of proponation, controlled by the hydrogen ion concentration of the external solution. Skin potential, short-circuit current and their relationship to PDI were discussed.},

Measured chl{\_}a correlated well with MERIS modeled phycocyanin (PC) concentration (R2=0.9458; p{\textless}0.01 (highly significant)) whilst chl{\_}a and TSM gave (R2=0.7344; p{\textless}0.05 (significant)). Modeled TSM and PC concentrations manifested a good relationship with each other (R2=9047; p{\textless}0.001 (very highly significant)). We conclude that remote sensing data allow simultaneous retrieval of different water quality parameters as well as providing near real time and space results that can be used by water managers and policy makers to monitor water bodies. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Adjustment of the water treatment process to changes in water quality is a focus area for engineers and managers of water treatment plants. The desired and preferred capability depends on timely and quantitative knowledge of water quality monitoring in terms of total suspended solids (TSS) concentrations. This paper presents the development of a suite of nowcasting and forecasting methods by using high-resolution remote-sensing-based monitoring techniques on a daily basis. First, the integrated data fusion and mining (IDFM) technique was applied to develop a near real-time monitoring system for daily nowcasting of the TSS concentrations. Then a nonlinear autoregressive neural network with external input (NARXNET) model was selected and applied for forecasting analysis of the changes in TSS concentrations over time on a rolling basis onward using the IDFM technique. The implementation of such an integrated forecasting and nowcasting approach was assessed by a case study at Lake Mead hosting the water intake for Las Vegas, Nevada, in the water-stressed western U.S. Long-term monthly averaged results showed no simultaneous impact from forest fire events on accelerating the rise of TSS concentration. However, the results showed a probable impact of a decade of drought on increasing TSS concentration in the Colorado River Arm and Overton Arm. Results of the forecasting model highlight the reservoir water level as a significant parameter in predicting TSS in Lake Mead. In addition, the R-squared value of 0.98 and the root mean square error of 0.5 between the observed and predicted TSS values demonstrates the reliability and application potential of this remote sensing-based early warning system in terms of TSS projections at a drinking water intake.},

A consistent physics-based processing chain was applied to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and RapidEye. Images gathered on 10 June 2014 were corrected for the atmospheric effects with the 6SV code. The computed remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) from MODIS and OLI were converted into water quality parameters by adopting a spectral inversion procedure based on a bio-optical model calibrated with optical properties of the lake. The same spectral inversion procedure was applied to RapidEye and to OLI data to map bottom depth. In situ measurements of Rrs and of concentrations of water quality parameters collected in five locations were used to evaluate the models. The bottom depth maps from OLI and RapidEye showed similar gradients up to 7 m (r = 0.72). The results indicate that: (1) the spatial and radiometric resolutions of OLI enabled mapping water constituents and bottom properties; (2) MODIS was appropriate for assessing water quality in the pelagic areas at a coarser spatial resolution; and (3) RapidEye had the capability to retrieve bottom depth at high spatial resolution. Future work should evaluate the performance of the three sensors in different bio-optical conditions.},

abstract = {We examined the effects of anthropogenic and climatic perturbations on nutrient–phytoplankton interactions and eutrophication in the waters of the largest estuarine systems in the U.S.A., the Chesapeake Bay (CB), Maryland/ Virginia, and the Neuse River Estuary/Pamlico Sound (NRE/PS) system, North Carolina. Both systems have experienced large post-World War II increases in nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) loading, and nutrient reductions have been initiated to alleviate symptoms of eutrophication. However, ecosystem-level effects of these nutrient reductions are strongly affected by hydrologic variability, including severe droughts and a recent increase in Atlantic hurricane activity. Phytoplankton community responses to these hydrologic perturbations, including storm surges and floods, were examined and when possible, compared for these systems. In both systems, the resulting variability in water residence time strongly influenced seasonal and longer-term patterns of phytoplankton biomass and community composition. Fast-growing diatoms were favored during years of high discharge and short residence time in CB, whereas this effect was not observed during high discharge conditions in the longer residence time NRE/ PS. In the NRE/PS, all phytoplankton groups except summer cyanobacterial populations showed decreased abundance during elevated flow years when compared to low flow years. Although hurricanes affected the CB less frequently than the NRE/PS, they nonetheless influenced floral composition in both systems. Seasonally, hydrologic perturbations, including droughts, floods, and storm-related deep mixing events, overwhelmed nutrient controls on floral composition. This underscores the difficulty in predicting seasonal and longer-term phytoplankton production and compositional responses to nutrient input reductions aimed at controlling eutrophication of large estuarine ecosystems.},

abstract = {Given the importance of coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) for the structure and function of lake ecosystems, a method to estimate the amount of CDOM in lake waters over large geographic areas would be highly desirable. Advanced Land Imager (ALI) images were acquired in southern Finland (in 2002) and southern Sweden (in 2003) together with in situ measurements of bio-optical properties of 34 lakes (39 measuring stations). Based on this dataset, a band-ratio type algorithm was developed using ALI band 2 and band 3 for estimating CDOM content (absorption of filtrated water at 420 nm) in lakes. Correlation between in situ measured CDOM and the remote sensing estimate of CDOM was high, r2=0.73. The CDOM retrieval algorithm obtained on the basis of two images and in situ data was validated on a third ALI image (eastern Finland, 2002) that was available in the ALI image archive. In situ water-colour monitoring data from 22 lakes (27 measuring stations) in the third image were available in a database of the Finnish Environment Administration. The water-colour data were converted to CDOM absorption values, which were then compared to the results from a third ALI image. The correlation between remotely estimated and in situ CDOM values in the algorithm validation image was high, r2=0.83. These results support the conclusion that CDOM content in lakes over a wide range of concentrations (aCDOM(420) between 0.68 and 11.13 m-1) can be mapped using Advanced Land Imager data. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Direct measurements of suspended sediment concentration (SSC) in rivers are surprisingly sparse. We present an approach for measuring these concentrations from space, tailored to fit rivers with limited records of flood-level SSC. Our approach requires knowledge of a typical particle-size distribution of sediment suspended during floods, the dominant mineralogy, and a calibration consisting of above-water reflectance field spectra with known SSC. Surface SSC values were derived for two Landsat images covering 70 km of the Feather and portions of the Sacramento, Yuba, and Bear Rivers in California in order to capture conditions during a large flood event. Using optical theory and radiative transfer modeling we modeled remote-sensing reflectance (Rrs) for a number of three-component mixtures composed of color dissolved organic matter (CDOM), water, and montmorillonite particles. We then iteratively estimated CDOM by fitting modeled spectra for a range of absorption coefficients to field-measured spectra collected from the Sacramento River and matched to measured SSC values. Spectral mixture analysis with a two-end-member model yielded end-member fractions and SSC via a look-up table specific to the Landsat sensor. Model closure was within the error of measured SSC values, suggesting that this approach is promising for deriving SSC on rivers during flood conditions when empirical relationships established between low SSC values and Rrs are no longer valid.},

abstract = {Monitoring water quality on a near-real-time basis to address water resource management and public health concerns in coupled natural systems and the built environment is by no means an easy task. Total organic carbon (TOC) in surface waters is a known precursor of disinfection by-products in drinking water treatment such as total trihalomethanes (TTHMs), which are a suspected carcinogen and have been related to birth defects if water treatment plants cannot remove them. In this paper, an early warning system using integrated data fusion and mining (IDFM) techniques was proposed to estimate spatiotemporal distributions of TOC on a daily basis for monitoring water quality in a lake that serves as the source of a drinking water treatment plant. Landsat satellite images have high spatial resolution, but such application suffers from a long overpass interval of 16 days. On the other hand, coarse-resolution sensors with frequent revisit times, such as MODIS, are incapable of providing detailed water quality information because of low spatial resolution. This issue can be resolved by using data or sensor fusion techniques, such as IDFM, in which the high-spatial-resolution Landsat and the high-temporal-resolution MODIS images are fused and analysed by a suite of regression models to optimally produce synthetic images with both high spatial and temporal resolution. Analysis of the results using four statistical indices confirmed that the genetic programming model can accurately estimate the spatial and temporal variations of TOC concentrations in a small lake. The model entails a slight bias towards overestimating TOC, and it requires cloud-free input data for the lake. The IDFM efforts lead to the reconstruction of the spatiotemporal TOC distributions in a lake in support of healthy drinking water treatment.},

abstract = {We present results of the quantitative monitoring and assessment of suspended sediment in Yellow River estuary from the imagery of TM and ETM. +. (TM/ETM. +) aboard Landsat satellites. The estuary is one of the world's most turbid areas with high concentration of suspended sediment ( SSC). As a result, an atmospheric correction algorithm is required for TM/ETM. + when applied to monitor SSC in the estuary. Remote sensing reflectance ( Rrs) at TM/ETM. + bands is retrieved using the air molecule and aerosol scattering information provided by MODIS aboard Terra satellite, which has highly improved radiometric calibration, sensitivity, and spectral bands designed for estimating aerosol radiance. Rrsat the red band is used for retrieving SSC by means of the model developed from in-situ data. TM/ETM. + measured water color products ( Rrsand SSC) are cross validated with MODIS measurements, which are validated by contemporaneous in-situ data. The cross validation shows that, with the proper atmospheric correction algorithm and retrieval model, TM/ETM. + data can be used to quantify the SSC in Yellow River estuary.Interannual and seasonal variations, as well as spatial distribution, of SSC in Yellow River estuary are studied and assessed using TM/ETM. + measurements from 2000 to 2010. Results show that the SSC is generally increasing from 2000 to the maximum in 2003 and then decreasing and is highly correlated with the annual total sediment discharge from Yellow River. The correlation is not so high for the SSC in Bohai and Laizhou bays. In addition, the SSC in the estuary is generally increasing from June to the maximum in Nov. and then decreasing to the minimum in April. The seasonal variation pattern results from Yellow River sediment discharge, which is higher in June-Nov., corresponding to the flood season than in other months. The SSC in Laizhou and Bohai bays generally follow the same seasonal variation pattern that is higher in Nov.-Apr. than in other months. The higher SSC mainly results from the wind-driven resuspension of bottom sediment. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Although previous investigations have demonstrated reliable empirical relationships between satellite data and nearly contemporaneous ground observations, satellite imagery has not been incorporated into routine lake monitoring programs. This paper focuses on key issues involved in applying satellite imagery to the regional assessment of lake clarity. Ten Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images and four Multispectral Scanner (MSS) images of the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area (TCMA) spanning 25 years (1973-1998) were analyzed. Based on this analysis, recommendations are made for a Landsat-based procedure for water clarity assessment. Closeness of fit (r2 values) of regression models between satellite brightness data and measured Secchi disk transparency (SDT) decreased with increasing size of the time window between image collection and ground observation of SDT. Use of SDT data collected within ±1 day of the image date is recommended, but where SDT data are limited, windows up to ±7 days yield reasonable results, especially in late summer when water clarity is relatively constant. Average brightness data from at least nine pixels in the deep open area of a lake should be used to predict lake clarity, but the accuracy of predicted SDT did not improve much as the number of pixels in the area of interest (AOI) increased above this value. A three-coefficient regression model using the TM1/TM3 ratio and TM1 was a consistent and reliable predictor of SDT (r2 values of .7-.8). A similar relationship involving the MSS1/MSS2 ratio and MSS1 was a reasonable predictor of SDT for MSS data. Efforts to produce a standard prediction equation for SDT applicable to images collected on different dates were not successful, but a simple regression procedure to account for differences in atmospheric conditions among image collection dates substantially decreased the range of coefficients in the regression model. {\textcopyright} 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Inc.},

Color (C440 ), as measured by absorbance at 440 nm, causes only small biases in estimates of Secchi disk transparency (SDT) from Landsat TM data, except at very high values ({\textgreater} {\~{}} 300 chloroplatinate units, CPU). Similarly, when chlorophyll a (chl a) levels are moderate or high ({\textgreater} 10 µg/L), low-to-moderate levels of humic color have only a small influence on the relationship between SDT and chl a concentration, but it has a pronounced influence at high levels of C440 (e.g., {\textgreater} {\~{}}200 CPU). However, deviations from the general chl a-SDT relationship occur at much lower C440 values ({\~{}} 60 CPU) when chl a levels are low. Good statistical relationships were found between optical properties of lake water generally associated with algal abundance (SDT, chl a, turbidity) and measured brightness of various Landsat TM bands. The best relationships for chl a (based on R2 and absence of statistical outliers or lakes with large leverage) were combinations of bands 1, 2, or 4 with the band ratio 1:3 (R2 = 0.88). Although TM bands 1-4 individually or as simple ratios were poor predictors of C440 , multiple regression analyses between ln(C440 ) and combinations of bands 1-4 and band ratios yielded several relationships with R2 ≥ 0.70, suggesting that C440 can be estimated with fair reliability from Landsat TM data.},

abstract = {Optical water quality (OWQ) governs the quantity and quality of light in aquatic ecosystems, and thus spatiotemporal changes in OWQ affect many biotic and abiotic processes. Despite the fundamental role of light in rivers, studies on riverine OWQ have been limited and mostly descriptive. Here we provide a comprehensive, quantitative analysis of the controls and spatiotemporal dynamics of riverine OWQ, focusing on the inherent optical properties (IOPs), which are those that are only affected by water constituents and not by changes in the solar radiation field. First, we briefly review the constituents attenuating light in rivers. Second, we develop a new method for partitioning (light) beam attenuation into its constituent fractions. This method distinguishes between absorption and scattering by dissolved and particulate constituents, and further isolates particulates into mineral and organic components. Third, we compare base flow IOPs between four rivers with vastly different physical characteristics to illustrate intersite variability. Fourth, we analyze the spatial and temporal patterns of IOPs for the four rivers. Fifth, we quantify a longitudinal water clarity budget for one of the rivers. Finally, available data are synthesized to identify general spatial trends robust across broad geographic areas. Temporal trends in IOPs were largely dictated by storm frequency, while spatial trends were largely dictated by channel network configuration. Generally, water clarity decreased with increasing discharge primarily owing to greater scattering by particulates and secondarily to greater absorption by chromophoric dissolved organic matter. Water clarity also generally decreased longitudinally along the river owing to increased particulate inputs from tributaries; however, for pear-shaped, dendritic basins, water clarity reached a minimum at 70{\%} of the channel length and then increased. By illustrating the controls and spatiotemporal variability of riverine OWQ, these findings will be of interest to water resource managers and fluvial ecologists and specifically for remote-sensing of fluvial environments and river plumes in receiving waters.},

abstract = {The number, size, and distribution of inland freshwater lakes present a challenge for traditional water-quality assessment due to the time, cost, and logistical constraints of field sampling and laboratory analyses. To overcome this challenge, Landsat imagery has been used as an effective tool to assess basic water-quality indicators, such as Secchi depth (SD), over a large region or to map more advanced lake attributes, such as cyanobacteria, for a single waterbody. The overarching objective of this research application was to evaluate Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) for mapping nine water-quality metrics over a large region and to identify hot spots of potential risk. The second objective was to evaluate the addition of landscape pattern metrics to test potential improvements in mapping lake attributes and to understand drivers of lake water quality in this region. Field-level in situ water-quality measurements were collected across diverse lakes (n = 42) within the Lower Peninsula of Michigan. A multicriteria statistical approach was executed to map lake water quality that considered variable importance, model complexity, and uncertainty. Overall, band ratio radiance models performed well (R},

abstract = {The concern about water quality in inland water bodies such as lakes and reservoirs has been increasing. Owing to the complexity associated with field collection of water quality samples and subsequent laboratory analyses, sci-entists and researchers have employed remote sensing tech-niques for water quality information retrieval. Due to the limitations of linear regression methods, many researchers have employed the artificial neural network (ANN) technique to decorrelate satellite data in order to assess water quality. In this paper, we propose a method that establishes the output sensi-tivity toward changes in the individual input reflectance chan-nels while modeling water quality from remote sensing data collected by Landsat thematic mapper (TM). From the sensitivi-ty, a hypothesis about the importance of each band can be made and used as a guideline to select appropriate input vari-ables (band combination) for ANN models based on the princi-ple of parsimony for water quality retrieval. The approach is illustrated through a case study of Beaver Reservoir in Arkansas, USA. The results of the case study are highly promis-ing and validate the input selection procedure outlined in this paper. The results indicate that this approach could significantly reduce the effort and computational time required to develop an ANN water quality model.},

This paper, however discusses the application of remote sensing and GIS specifically in monitoring water quality parameters in Al-Habbaniyah Lake, and the results were compared with in situ measurements. Variations of different parameters under investigation were as follows: temperature (15-33°C), pH (7-9), dissolved oxygen (6-11mg/L), BOD5 (0.5-1.8), electrical conductivity (200-2280 $\mu$S/cm), TDS (147-1520 mg/L), TSS (68-3200), turbidity (5-51), nitrate (0.7-20 mg/l), phosphate (77-220 $\mu$g/l), and chlorophyll-a (0.9-130 $\mu$g/l). Remote sensing results revealed that the band 5 was most likely significantly correlated with turbidity in the winter. Band 2 and 3 was most likely significantly correlated with TDS in autumn and summer, while band 2 was most likely significantly correlated with TSS in autumn, band 2 is most likely significantly correlated with chlorophyll-a in autumn. The current study results demonstrated convergence between in situ and remote sensing readings. The models were used to explore the values of each of chlorophyll-a, TSS,TDS, and turbidity did not deviate much from the values actually measured in the three seasons. Nevertheless, they were very useful in anticipating all seasons of the study due to the insignificant deviation between the remotely sensed values and actual measured values.},

abstract = {Water clarity is a reliable indicator of lake productivity and an ideal metric of regional water quality. Clarity is an indicator of other water quality variables including chlorophyll-a, total phosphorus and trophic status; however, unlike these metrics, clarity can be accurately and efficiently estimated remotely on a regional scale. Remote sensing is useful in regions containing a large number of lakes that are cost prohibitive to monitor regularly using traditional field methods. Field-assessed lakes generally are easily accessible and may represent a spatially irregular, non-random sample of a region. We developed a remote monitoring program for Maine lakes {\textgreater}8ha (1511 lakes) to supplement existing field monitoring programs. We combined Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) brightness values for TM bands 1 (blue) and 3 (red) to estimate water clarity (secchi disk depth) during 1990-2010. Although similar procedures have been applied to Minnesota and Wisconsin lakes, neither state incorporates physical lake variables or watershed characteristics that potentially affect clarity into their models. Average lake depth consistently improved model fitness, and the proportion of wetland area in lake watersheds also explained variability in clarity in some cases. Nine regression models predicted water clarity (R2=0.69-0.90) during 1990-2010, with separate models for eastern (TM path 11; four models) and western Maine (TM path 12; five models that captured differences in topography and landscape disturbance. Average absolute difference between model-estimated and observed secchi depth ranged 0.65-1.03m. Eutrophic and mesotrophic lakes consistently were estimated more accurately than oligotrophic lakes. Our results show that TM bands 1 and 3 can be used to estimate regional lake water clarity outside the Great Lakes Region and that the accuracy of estimates is improved with additional model variables that reflect physical lake characteristics and watershed conditions. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The reaction of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) with silicate rocks provides a carbon sink that helps counterbalance the release of CO2 by volcanic degassing. However, some types of rocks contain petrogenic organic carbon, the oxidation of which adds CO2 to the atmosphere, counteracting the drawdown by silicates. Hemingway et al. present evidence from the rapidly eroding Central Range of Taiwan showing that microbes oxidize roughly two-thirds of the petrogenic organic carbon there and that the rate of oxidation increases with the rate of erosion.
Abstract

Lithospheric organic carbon (“petrogenic”; OCpetro) is oxidized during exhumation and subsequent erosion of mountain ranges. This process is a considerable source of carbon dioxide (CO2) to the atmosphere over geologic time scales, but the mechanisms that govern oxidation rates in mountain landscapes are poorly constrained. We demonstrate that, on average, 67 ± 11{\%} of the OCpetro initially present in bedrock exhumed from the tropical, rapidly eroding Central Range of Taiwan is oxidized in soils, leading to CO2 emissions of 6.1 to 18.6 metric tons of carbon per square kilometer per year. The molecular and isotopic evolution of bulk OC and lipid biomarkers during soil formation reveals that OCpetro remineralization is microbially mediated. Rapid oxidation in mountain soils drives CO2 emission fluxes that increase with erosion rate, thereby counteracting CO2 drawdown by silicate weathering and biospheric OC burial.

abstract = {Surface coal mining fractures geologic materials to access coal seams. The excavated rock materials (mine spoils) have freshly exposed mineral surfaces that weather rapidly and release soluble ions to streams during and after site reclamation. The soluble ion release is directly influenced by the mine spoil mineralogy. We examined relationships among mine spoil mineralogical and geochemical properties and soluble ion release for the purpose of determining their influence on Appalachian stream water quality. We determined the mineralogy, bulk spoil composition, leachate concentrations, and acid-base accounting (ABA) parameters of 16 non-acid-forming spoil samples. Mineralogical composition was determined using thin section spectroscopy, a column leaching experiment was conducted to determine eluted leachate concentrations of 15 elements, and ABA parameters were determined using conventional methodologies. Results indicated that the mine spoils were comprised predominantly of quartz, with smaller amounts of plagioclase and K-feldspars, lithic metamorphic fragments, muscovite, chlorite, and goethite. Cementing agents included quartz, kaolinite, siderite, and carbonate. Indicators of weathering observed in samples presumed to be unweathered included halloysite at the expense of feldspar and goethite at the expense of pyrite and siderite. On an oxide basis, SiO2and Al2O3dominated the bulk geochemical composition. Sulfate had the largest initial leachate concentration whereas HCO3−was the dominant anion in final leachates. The ABA tests indicated most spoils were non-acid-forming, with total sulfur values ranging from 0.01 to 0.38{\%}. Relatively high dissolved sulfate elution was attributed to trace pyrites. Carbonates were not observed in many samples, indicating other mineral sources neutralized the acid produced by pyrite oxidation. Feldspar hydrolysis and the weathering of metamorphic lithic fragments (schists), chlorite, and muscovite may have been responsible, in part, for soluble ion release and acid-neutralization. Bulk Mg contents often exceeded Ca for most samples, and high Mg:Ca ratios in leachate concentrations relative to regional waters may be attributed to chlorite weathering. Historically, high levels of soluble ion release was assumed to be controlled by sulfide oxidation reactions coupled with carbonate neutralization reactions. These results, however, indicate that other minerals typically presumed to be relatively stable also contribute significantly to overall soluble ion release in this highly disturbed environment. Minimizing the amount of time water is in contact with mine spoils and, by extension, decreasing the potentials for chemical weathering, may assist with controlling soluble ion discharges from Appalachian coal mining areas.},

Weathering of calcium and magnesium silicates is the primary sink for atmospheric CO2, yet alkali feldspar dissolution rates or data from carbonate aquifers have generally been used as model inputs instead. The latter causes calculated CO2 levels and temperatures to be anomalously high in the model of Berner et al. (1983) (for example, temperatures of 24-degrees-C and 19-degrees-C are calculated for the Cretaceous and Eocene, respectively). When Ca and Mg silicate weathering rates are used as primary inputs instead, ambient temperatures and atmospheric CO2 levels are calculated to be significantly closer to recent preindustrial levels (global mean temperatures of approximately 20.5-degrees-C and 17.5-degrees-C in the Cretaceous and Eocene, respectively), indicating an appreciably tighter coupling between chemical weathering and climate.},

abstract = {We present a new space-efficient approach, (SparseDTW), to compute the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance between two time series that always yields the optimal result. This is in contrast to other known approaches which typically sacrifice optimality to attain space efficiency. The main idea behind our approach is to dynamically exploit the existence of similarity and/or correlation between the time series. The more the similarity between the time series the less space required to compute the DTW between them. To the best of our knowledge, all other techniques to speedup DTW, impose apriori constraints and do not exploit similarity characteristics that may be present in the data. We conduct experiments and demonstrate that SparseDTW outperforms previous approaches.},

abstract = {The development of held sampling designs that employ multiple reference and polluted sites has been proposed as an alternative to the traditional upstream vs, downstream approach used in most biomonitoring studies. Spatially extensive monitoring programs can characterize ecological conditions within an ecoregion and provide the necessary background information to evaluate future changes in water quality. We measured physicochemical characteristics, heavy-metal concentrations, and benthic macroinvertebrate community structure at 95 sites in the Southern Rocky Mountain ecoregion in Colorado, USA. Most sites (82{\%}) were selected using a systematic, randomized sampling design. Each site was placed into one of four metal categories (background, low, medium, and high metals), based on the cumulative criterion unit (CCU), which we defined as the ratio of the instream metal concentration to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency criterion concentration, summed for all metals measured. A CCU of 1.0 represents a conservative estimate of: the total metal concentration that, when exceeded, is likely td cause harm to aquatic organisms. Although the CCU was less than 2.0 at most (66.3{\%}) of the sites, values exceeded 10.0 at 13 highly polluted stations. Differences among metal categories were highly significant for most measures of macroinvertebrate abundance and all measures of species richness. We observed the greatest effects on several species of heptageniid mayflies (Ephemeroptera: Heptageniidae), which were highly sensitive to heavy metals and were reduced by {\textgreater}75{\%} at moderately polluted stations. The influence of taxonomic aggregation on responses to metals was also greatest for mayflies. In general, total abundance of mayflies and abundance of heptageniids were better indicators of metal pollution than abundance of dominant mayfly taxa. We used stepwise multiple-regression analyses to investigate the relationship between benthic community measures and physicochemical characteristics at the 78 randomly selected sites. Heavy-metal concentration was the most important predictor of benthic community structure at these sites. Because of the ubiquitous distribution of heavy-metal pollution in the Southern Rocky Mountain ecoregion, we conclude that potential effects of heavy metals should be considered when investigating large-scale spatial patterns of benthic macroinvertebrate communities in Colorado's mountain streams},

abstract = {Among the species in the family Salmonidae, those represented by the genera Salmo, Salvelinus, and Oncorhynchus (subfamily Salmoninae) are the most studied. Here, various aspects of phenotypic and life-history variation of Atlantic salmon Salmo salar L., brown trout Salmo trutta L., and Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus (L.) are reviewed. While many strategies and tactics are commonly used by these species, there are also differences in their ecology and population dynamics that result in a variety of interesting and diverse topics that are challenging for future research. Atlantic salmon display considerable phenotypic plasticity and variability in life-history characters ranging from fully freshwater resident forms, where females can mature at approximately 10cm in length, to anadromous populations characterised by 3–5 sea-winter (5SW) salmon. Even within simple 1SW populations, 20 or more spawning life-history types can be identified. Juveniles in freshwater can use both fluvial and lacustrine habitats for rearing, and while most smolts migrate to sea during the spring, fall migrations occur in some populations. At sea, some salmon undertake extensive oceanic migrations while other populations stay within the geographical confines of areas such as the Baltic Sea. At the other extreme are those that reside in estuaries and return to freshwater to spawn after spending only a few months at sea. The review of information on the diversity of life-history forms is related to conservation aspects associated with Atlantic salmon populations and current trends in abundance and survival. Brown trout is indigenous to Europe, North Africa and western Asia, but was introduced into at least 24 countries outside Europe and now has a world-wide distribution. It exploits both fresh and salt waters for feeding and spawning (brackish), and populations are often partially migratory. One part of the population leaves and feeds elsewhere, while another part stays as residents. In large, complex systems, the species is polymorphic with different size morphs in the various parts of the habitat. Brown trout feed close to the surface and near shore, but large individuals may move far offshore. The species exhibits ontogenetic niche shifts partly related to size and partly to developmental rate. They switch when the amount of surplus energy available for growth becomes small with fast growers being younger and smaller fish than slow growers. Brown trout is an opportunistic carnivore, but individuals specialise at least temporarily on particular food items; insect larvae are important for the young in streams, while littoral epibenthos in lakes and fish are most important for large trout. The sexes differ in resource use and size. Females are more inclined than males to become migratory and feed in pelagic waters. Males exploit running water, near-shore and surface waters more than females. Therefore, females feed more on zooplankton and exhibit a more uniform phenotype than males. The Arctic charr is the northernmost freshwater fish on earth, with a circumpolar distribution in the Holarctic that matches the last glaciation. Recent mtDNA studies indicate that there are five phylogeographic lineages (Atlantic, Arctic, Bering, Siberian and Acadian) that may be of Pleistocene origin. Phenotypic expression and ecology are more variable in charr than in most fish. Weights at maturation range from 3 g to 12 kg. Population differences in morphology and coloration are large and can have some genetic basis. Charr live in streams, at sea and in all habitats of oligotrophic lakes, including very deep areas. Ontogenetic habitat shifts between lacustrine habitats are common. The charr feed on all major prey types of streams, lakes and near-shore marine habitats, but has high niche flexibility in competition. Cannibalism is expressed in several cases, and can be important for developing and maintaining bimodal size distributions. Anadromy is found in the northern part of its range and involves about 40, but sometimes more days in the sea. All charr overwinter in freshwater. Partial migration is common, but the degree of anadromy varies greatly among populations. The food at sea includes zooplankton and pelagic fish, but also epibenthos. Polymorphism and sympatric morphs are much studied. As a prominent fish of glaciated lakes, charr is an important species for studying ecological speciation by the combination of field studies and experiments, particularly in the fields of morphometric heterochrony and comparative behaviour.},

The Upper Animas River watershed, located in San Juan Colorado, is heavily mineralized and impacted by acid mine drainage, with low pH water and elevated metal concentrations in sediments (108.4 ± 1.8 mg kg–1 Pb, 32.4 ± 0.5 mg kg–1 Cu, 729.6 ± 5.7 mg kg–1 Zn, and 51 314.6 ± 295.4 mg kg–1 Fe). Phosphate and nitrogen species were detected in water and sediment samples from Farmington, New Mexico, an intensive agricultural area downstream from the Animas River, while metal concentrations were low compared to those observed upstream.

abstract = {1. Evaluating the effectiveness of stream restoration is often challenging because of the lack of pre-treatment data, narrow focus on physicochemical measures and insufficient post-restoration monitoring. Even when these fundamental elements are present, quantifying restoration success is difficult because of the challenges associated with distinguishing treatment effects from seasonal variation, episodic events and long-term climatic changes. 2. Wereport results of one of themost comprehensive and continuous records of physical, chemical and biological data available to assess restoration success for a streamecosysteminNorthAmerica. Over a 17 year period we measured seasonal and annual changes in metal concentrations, physicochemical characteristics, macroinvertebrate communities, and brown trout Salmo trutta populations in the Arkansas River, ametal-contaminated streaminColorado,USA. 3. Although we observed significant improvements in water quality after treatment, the effective- ness of restoration varied temporally, spatially andamong biological response variables.The fastest recovery was observed at stations where restoration eliminated point sources of metal contamina- tion. Recovery of macroinvertebrates was significantly delayed at some stations because of residual sediment contamination and because extreme seasonal and episodic variation in metal concentra- tions prevented recolonization by sensitive species. 4. Synthesis and applications. Because recovery trajectories after the removal of a stressor are often complex or nonlinear, long-term studies are necessary to assess restoration success within the con- text of episodic events and changes in regional climate. The observed variation in recovery among chemical and biological endpoints highlights the importance of developing objective criteria to assess restoration success. Although the rapid response of macroinvertebrates to reduced metal concentrations is encouraging, we have previously demonstrated that benthic communities from the Arkansas River remained susceptible to other novel anthropogenic stressors. We suggest that the resistance or resilience of benthic macroinvertebrate communities to novel stressors may be effective indicators of restoration success that can account for the non-additive (e.g. synergistic) nat- ure of compound perturbations.},

abstract = {Red drums Sciaenops ocellatus were sampled in North Carolina waters from October 1987 through December 1990. Ages determined from sectioned otoliths were validated by length-frequency and marginal-increment analyses, and the recapture of oxytetracycline-marked fish. Fish growth was rapid during the first 5 years, after which annual growth increments were much smaller. Growth was best described by a continuous double von Bertalanffy growth curve, with a transition age of 4.4 years; K sub(1), the growth coefficient for fish younger than the transition age, was 0.30/year and K sub(2), the growth coefficient for fish older than the transition age, was 0.07/year. Maximum observed age and size were 56 years and 1,250 mm fork length (FL) for males and 52 years and 1,346 mm FL for females. Fifty-percent maturity was attained among males by age 2 at 621-640 mm FL and among females by age 3 at 801-820 mm FL. Spawning occurred from August through early October in estuarine waters of Pamlico Sound and nearshore ocean waters close to barrier island inlets. Commercial and recreational landings increased during the 1980s, with most of the harvest composed of immature, age-1 fish caught during the fall. Unadjusted annual return rates (18-25{\%}) for tagged juveniles were high. Annual survival rates based on tag-recapture data were only 6-24{\%}, and estimates of instantaneous total mortality rates (Z) from cohort-based catch curves were 1.56-2.88 for the 1985-1988 year-classes.

abstract = {Little is known about the distribution, movement, and home ranges of bluegills Lepomis macrochirus in lentic environments. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to evaluate the seasonal and diel differences in movement rates, site fidelity, and home range of bluegills in a shallow, natural Great Plains lake. A total of 78 bluegills (200-273 mm total length) were implanted with radio transmitters in March and May 2000. Of these fish, 10 males and 10 females were randomly selected and located every 2 h during one 24-h period each month from April to September 2000. Bluegill movement peaked during midsummer; however, there was little difference in diel movements, suggesting relatively consistent movement throughout the 24-h period. Home range estimates (which included the 24-h tracking plus an additional six locations from the same fish located once per day for six consecutive days each month) ranged up to 172 ha, probably because only about half of the bluegills exhibited site fidelity during any month sampled. Bluegill movement did not appear to be strongly linked with water temperature, barometric pressure, or wind speed. These results suggest that bluegills move considerable distances and that many roam throughout this 332-ha shallow lake. However, diet patterns were not evident. Sampling bluegills in Great Plains lakes using passive gears (e.g., trap nets) may be most effective during the summer months, when fish are most active. Active sampling (e.g., electrofishing) may be more effective than the use of passive gears in spring and fall, when bluegills are less active},

abstract = {Otoliths, calcified inner ear structures, were collected from creek chubs (Semotilus atromaculatus) and green sunfish (Lepomis cyanellus) living in mountaintop mining-impacted and reference streams and analyzed for selenium (Se) content using laser ablation-inductively coupled mass spectrometry. Significant differences in otolith Se were found between the 2 fish species. Results from the present study suggest that a retrospective reconstruction of Se concentrations in muscle can be derived from Se concentrations in otoliths in creek chub but not green sunfish, exemplifying the importance of species differences when determining partitioning of Se among specific tissues. Green sunfish otoliths from all sites contained background ({\textless}1g/g) or low (1-4g/g) average concentrations of whole-otolith Se. In contrast, creek chub otoliths from the historically mined site contained much higher (5g/g) concentrations of Se than for the same species in the unmined site or for the green sunfish. These data suggest that body burdens of Se in fish can vary considerably over time and that both the timing of sampling and species choice could heavily influence Se assessments.

abstract = {Spatial variation in the chemistry (Mg, Mn, Sr and Ba) of recently deposited otolith material (last 20-30 days of life) was compared between two demersal fish species; snapper Pagrus auratus (Sparidae) and sand flathead Platycephalus bassensis (Platycephalidae), that were collected simultaneously at 12 sites across three bays in Victoria, south-eastern Australia. Otolith chemistry was also compared with ambient water chemistry and among three sampling positions adjacent to the proximal otolith margin. For both species, variation in otolith chemistry among bays was significant for Ba, Mn and Sr; however, differences among bays were only similar between species for Ba and Mn. Only Ba showed significant variation at the site level. Across the 12 sites, mean otolith Ba levels were significantly positively correlated between species. Further, although incorporation rates differed, mean ambient Ba levels for both species were positively correlated with ambient Ba levels. Spatial variation in multi-element otolith chemistry was also broadly similar between species and with multi-element water chemistry. Partition coefficients clearly indicated species-specific incorporation of elements into otoliths. Mg and Mn were consistently higher in snapper than sand flathead otoliths (mean ±s.d., Mg snapper 22.1 ±3.8 and sand flathead 9.9 ±1.5 mg g-1, Mn snapper 4.4 ±2.6 and sand flathead 0.5 ± 0.3 mg g-1), Sr was generally higher in sand flathead otoliths (sand flathead 1570 ±235 and snapper 1346 ±104 mg g-1) and Ba was generally higher in snapper otoliths (snapper 12.1 ±12.8 and sand flathead 1.8 ±1.4 mg g-1). For both species, Mg and Mn were higher in the faster accreting regions of the otolith margin, Sr was lower in the slower accreting region and Ba showed negligible variation among the three sampling regions. This pattern was consistent with the higher Mg and Mn, and generally lower Sr observed in the faster accreting snapper otoliths. It is hypothesized that the differences between species in the incorporation of these elements may be at least partly related to differences in metabolic and otolith accretion rate. Although rates of elemental incorporation into otoliths appear species specific, for elements such as Ba where incorporation appears consistently related to ambient concentrations, spatial variation in otolith chemistry should show similarity among co-occurring species.},

Opaque bands and marginal increments formed in bluegill otoliths at similar temperatures in outdoors tanks, in 2 lakes, and in the laboratory. Opaque bands also were induced by changes in photoperiod and feeding rate; however, the effects of photoperiod and feeding rate were inconsistent, and the opaque bands formed were typically faint compared to those resulting from temperature changes.

abstract = {Scanning proton microprobe (SPM) analysis and imaging was used to map the distribution of zinc in otoliths of anadromous and non-anadromous Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) from the Canadian Arctic. Zinc distribution patterns were oscillatory with concentrations ranging from 35 to 240 ppm. Superimposition of the zinc distribution on optical images of the otoliths permitted correlation of zinc uptake with annular structure in the otoliths and with strontium patterns from the same otolith. Well defined oscillations of zinc concentrations were observed in the otoliths particularly in the first few years in all samples. In anadromous fish, these overlapped with the onset of the strontium oscillations that were indicative of anadromy and then declined; in non-anadromous fish the oscillations generally continued to later years. Oscillatory zoning of zinc may indicate: (1) variations in the concentration of zinc in water; (2) variations in nutrient availability in the environment; (3) temperature variations in the habitat occupied; or (4) a combination of zinc concentration, nutrient availability or temperature changes. As such, the systematic distribution of zinc in otoliths has the potential to provide temporally constrained information on fish habitat and/or fish biology. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {In many environmental contaminant situations selenium has become the primary element of concern because of its bioaccumulative nature in food webs. Initial concerns about selenium were related to fish kills at Belews Lake, NC, Martin Lake, TX, and Kesterson Reservoir, CA, and to bird deformities at Kesterson Reservoir. Additional concerns were identified under the National Irrigation Water Quality Program at Salton Sea, CA, Kendrick, WY, Stewart Lake, UT, and Grand Valley and Uncompahgre Valley, CO. Recent studies have raised concerns about selenium impacts on aquatic resources in Southeastern Idaho and British Columbia. The growing discomfort among the scientific community with a waterborne criterion has lead the US Environment Protection Agency to consider a tissue-based criterion for selenium. Some aquatic ecosystems have been slow to recover from selenium contamination episodes. In recent years, non-governmental researchers have been proposing relatively high selenium thresholds in diet and tissue relative to those proposed by governmental researchers. This difference in opinions is due in part to the selection of datasets and caveats in selecting scientific literature. In spite of the growing selenium literature, there are needs for additional research on neglected organisms. This review also discusses the interaction of selenium with other elements, inconsistent effects of selenium on survival and growth of fish, and differences in depuration rates and sensitivity among species.},

abstract = {The elemental fingerprints or composition of otoliths of fish may provide a natural tag of the 'nursery' habitat of juvenile fish. The natural tag could then be used to determine the 'nursery' habitat of adult fish found on coastal reefs. We collected juvenile Pelates sexlineatus from 2 to 5 sites within each of 7 estuaries to determine whether elemental composition of otoliths differed among estuaries and among sites within estuaries. In addition, fish were collected in 2 successive years to determine whether temporal differences may be found in elemental fingerprints that could then confound subsequent assignment of adults to 'nursery' estuaries. Significant differences in elemental fingerprints (Sr, Ba and Mn) were found within and among estuaries, but there was often an interaction with time suggesting that there were differences among estuaries/sites but the difference varied between times. Quadratic discriminant functions (QDFs) generated to discriminate among estuaries suggested that the QDFs calculated from a single year class were more successful at assigning fish to the correct estuary than either (1) QDFs based on both years combined or (2) using the QDFs generated from the first year class to classify the second year class. Small-scale variability among sites within an estuary suggested that for an estuarine fishery we may be able to classify fish to their site of origin; this warrants further investigation. Adult fish from a coastal fishery can now be assigned to their 'nursery' estuary by analysing the juvenile region of their otoliths, provided that discriminant functions are generated from the appropriate year class of recruits.},

abstract = {Iolite is a non-commercial software package developed to aid in the processing of inorganic mass spectrometric data, with a strong emphasis on visualisation versus time of acquisition. The goal of the software is to provide a powerful framework for data processing and interpretation, while giving users the ability to implement their own data reduction protocols. It is intended to be highly interactive, providing the user with a complete overview of the data at all stages of processing, and allowing the freedom to change parameters and reprocess data at any point. The program presents a variety of windows for the selection and viewing of data versus time, as well as features for the generation of X-Y plots, summary reports and export of data. In addition, it is capable of generating X-Y images from laser ablation rasters, and combining information from up to four separate elemental concentrations (intensities of red, green and blue, and the z-axis) in a false-colour three-dimensional image. By virtue of its underlying computing environment-Igor Pro-Iolite is capable of processing very large datasets (i.e., millions of timeslices) rapidly, and is thus ideal for the interrogation of multi-hour sessions of laser ablation data that can not be easily manipulated in conventional spreadsheet applications, for example. It is also well suited to multi-day sessions of solution-mode inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICPMS) or thermal ionisation mass spectrometer (TIMS) data. A strong emphasis is placed on the interpolation of parameters that vary with time by a variety of user selectable methods including smoothed cubic splines. Data are processed on a timeslice-by-timeslice basis, allowing outlier rejection and calculation of statistics to be employed directly on calculated results. This approach can reduce the risk of processing biases associated with the manipulation of integrated datasets, while also allowing the implementation of more complex data reduction methods.},

In the second experiment, fish were exposed to waterborne Zn concentrations of {\textless} 0.005 $\mu$g L- 1(control), 50 $\mu$g L- 1, 100 $\mu$g L- 1and 200 $\mu$g L- 1for 35 days. The sagittal otoliths were analysed using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). Juvenile fish exposed to higher concentrations of waterborne Zn did not display increased Zn levels in their otoliths. However, Zn levels in the otoliths of fish consuming the Zn-enriched diet were significantly higher relative to control fish. This study clearly demonstrated that dietary Zn was the major source of Zn incorporated into the otoliths by this marine fish. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Mercury was undetectable, but selenium, rarely reported in otoliths and known as a physiological antagonist to mercury, was. Strontium was also present but appeared to be taken up independently of selenium, and thus these serve as independent biogeochemical markers. Both selenium and mercury were detected in fish tissues, but selenium was below levels considered toxic. Selenium was low in otoliths of fishes collected in nearby Oneida Lake. Synoptic surveys of water chemistry revealed that Se is regionally highest in Onondaga Lake and in particular its main inlet, Onondaga Creek. SXFM appears to be a sensitive method for detecting selenium in otoliths.},

abstract = {The fish otolith (earstone) has long been known as a timekeeper, but interest in its use as a metabolically inert environmental recorder has accelerated in recent years. In part due to technological advances, applications such as stock identification, determination of migration pathways, reconstruction of temperature and salinity history, age validation, detection of anadromy, use as a natural tag and chemical mass marking have been developed, some of which are difficult or impossible to implement using alternative techniques. Microsampling and the latest advances in beam-based probes allow many elemental assays to be coupled with daily or annual growth increments, thus providing a detailed chronological record of the environment. However, few workers have critically assessed the assumptions upon which the environmental reconstructions are based, or considered the possibility that elemental incorporation into the otolith may proceed differently than that into other calcified structures. This paper reviews current applications and their assumptions and suggests future directions. Particular attention is given to the premises that the elemental and isotopic composition of the otolith reflects that of the environment, and the effect of physiological filters on the resulting composition. The roles of temperature, elemental uptake into the fish and the process of otolith crystallization are also assessed. Drawing upon recent advances in geochemistry and paleoclimate research as points of contrast, it appears that not all applications of otolith chemistry are firmly based, although others are destined to become powerful and perhaps routine tools for the mainstream fish biologist.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017, Canadian Science Publishing. All rights reserved. Exploiting the chemical and growth properties of otoliths, this study demonstrates how environmental archives with high temporal resolution can be developed. Elemental profiles (Ba:Ca and Sr:Ca) of fish otoliths (ear bones) from the estuarine species Acanthopagrus butcheri (black bream) were related to growth increments on a seasonal time scale. A series of mixed effects models were used to investigate biological, temporal, and environmental factors influencing seasonal otolith elemental profiles. Resultant seasonally resolved chemical chronologies were correlated with environmental data (i.e., salinity) to develop an element–salinity regression function, which when fit to an independently derived chemical chronology showed strong agreement between reconstructed and recorded salinities. Support for the element–salinity regression function through independent verification provided confidence in environmental reconstructions derived from an archaeological otolith. This suggests otoliths can be used to reconstruct past environmental conditions over decadal and centennial time scales. Moreover, the application of mixed effect models to develop chemical chronologies also provides information on drivers of elemental profiles and allows a range of ecological questions to be addressed. This approach may be further adapted and employed across a broader range of taxonomic groups and environments.},

abstract = {Establishing exposure to contaminants within a given environment is often difficult for fish species with large home ranges. Chemical analyses of muscle or visceral tissue are useful indicators of recent exposure, but depuration, metabolic transformation, and tissue redistributions can alter temporal resolution. Otoliths are metabolically stable and thus provide complete chemical records within their calcified tissues that, when coupled to the annular structure, can provide temporal resolution for exposure to trace metals. Otoliths from bull trout, cutthroat trout, and mountain whitefish from an area rich in seleniferous soils and with active coal mining activity were analyzed for selenium to determine any history of exposure to elevated levels of selenium. Selenium concentrations in otolith primordia tended to be low, indicating that these fish emerged in low selenium areas. Later life stages showed peaks of high Se concentrations, suggesting that individuals moved into areas of increased selenium later in life. Individuals captured from the same area had a wide variety of selenium exposure profiles, indicating that these fish do not move en masse into and out of high-selenium areas. Year-to-year variability of selenium exposure patterns within an otolith suggests inconsistent utilization of high- and low-selenium areas by the individual. The inconsistent exposure profiles for these fish, in addition to their home range of tens of kilometres, indicate that soft tissue concentrations, while useful indicators of recent exposure, cannot be relied upon to provide a life history recording of exposure.},

abstract = {Specific trace elements incorporated into the growing surface of the fish otolith reflect the physical and chemical characteristics of the ambient water, although not necessarily in a simplistic manner. Since fish which spend at least part of their lives in different water masses often produce otoliths of different elemental composition, the otolith elemental composition (‘elemental fingerprint') can serve as an environmentally induced tag of groups of fish. On the basis of isotope dilution ICPMS (ID-ICPMS) assays of nearly 2500 dissolved adult cod (Gadus morhua) otoliths, it has become clear that cod otolith elemental fingerprints based on the elements Li, Mg, Mn, Sr and Ba are physically stable, reproducible and consistent between left and right otoliths. Highly significant differences existed among the fingerprints of all of the spawning aggregations, resulting in a characteristic marker for each aggregation. Long-term stability (4–13 years) of the fingerprints for a given spawning group was not evident, indicating that the fingerprint was not a proxy for genetic identity. However, the fingerprint was very stable over the short-term (up to 1 year), suggesting that it could serve as a seasonally stable biological tracer, or natural tag, of pre-defined groups of fish, even during situations of extensive stock mixing. As an illustration of the tracer approach, a maximum likelihood-based stock mixture analysis was applied to feeding (summer) and over-wintering stock distributions, using the fingerprints of the spring spawning aggregations as known-stock reference samples. The results of the summer stock mixture analyses suggested that the mixture analysis was accurate within 1{\%}, while the stock mixture analysis of the over-wintering schools produced stock-specific distributions which would have been difficult to obtain using alternative approaches. While the use of elemental fingerprints as natural tags is not suited to all stock mixing situations, suitability can probably be determined beforehand on the basis of existing environmental and biological information.},

abstract = {Ecological risks from metal contaminants are difficult to document because responses differ among species, threats differ among metals, and environmental influences are complex. Unifying concepts are needed to better tie together such complexities. Here we suggest that a biologically based conceptualization, the biodynamic model, provides the necessary unification for a key aspect in risk: metal bioaccumulation (internal exposure). The model is mechanistically based, but empirically considers geochemical influences, biological differences, and differences among metals. Forecasts from the model agree closely with observations from nature, validating its basic assumptions. The biodynamic metal bioaccumulation model combines targeted, high-quality geochemical analyses from a site of interest with parametrization of key physiological constants for a species from that site. The physiological parameters include metal influx rates from water, influx rates from food, rate constants of loss, and growth rates (when high). We compiled results from 15 publications that forecast species-specific bioaccumulation, and compare the forecasts to bioaccumulation data from the field. These data consider concentrations that cover 7 orders of magnitude. They include 7 metals and 14 species of animals from 3 phyla and 11 marine, estuarine, and freshwater environments. The coefficient of determination (R2) between forecasts and independently observed bioaccumulation from the field was 0.98. Most forecasts agreed with observations within 2-fold. The agreement suggests that the basic assumptions of the biodynamic model are tenable. A unified explanation of metal bioaccumulation sets the stage for a realistic understanding of toxicity and ecological effects of metals in nature.},

abstract = {This paper applies concepts of landscape ecology and patch dynamics to lotic systems. We present a framework for the investigation of pattern and process in lotic ecosystems that considers how specific patch characteristics determine biotic and abiotic processes over various scales. Patch characteristics include: size, size distribution within the landscape, juxtaposition, diversity, duration, and mechanisms affecting patch formation. Several topics of current interest in lotic ecology are examined from a patch-dynamics perspective: (1) response of periphyton communities to nutrient patches; (2) effects of patch dynamics on nutrient spiralling; (3) riparian patch dynamics and effects of leaf litter characteristics on lotic food webs; (4) beaver-induced patch dynamics; and (5) patch dynamics of river floodplains. We conclude that a patch-dynamics perspective coupled with a strong experimental approach can enhance the utility and predictive power of unifying concepts in lotic ecology, such as the river continuum hypothesis and nutrient spiralling, through its focus on organismal and process-specific building blocks of lotic systems. The effectiveness of a patch-dynamics approach as a framework for the study of lotic systems lies in the strength of the linkage between reductionist and whole-stream perspectives.},

abstract = {We revisit the serial discontinuity concept (SDC), which predicts river ecosystem responses to stream regulation in the context of recovery with distance downstream from the dam (discontinuity distance). Many studies have described pervasive interruptions of natural biophysical gradients of dams by comparing conditions in tailwaters to reference or pre-impoundment conditions. But only a few studies provide data or interpretations that explicitly test the SDC within entire stream corridors or along specifically defined reaches where recovery was expected in view of the predictions of the SDC. We present discontinuity distance measures for nine rivers around the world where the predictions of the SDC were substantiated. In two cases, recovery trajectories were overwhelmed by other human sources of disturbance. In one case, the SDC did not hold up, but only biotic measures were made. We conclude that, in general, the SDC is a sound construct that in most cases can be used to predict, or at least clearly articulate, the consequences of new regulation. The next step is to develop better empirical models of the SDC and to validate them experimentally through re-regulation of entire river corridors. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

@article{Raymond2016,
abstract = {Hydrological precipitation and snowmelt events trigger large " pulse " releases of terrestrial dissolved organic matter (DOM) into drainage networks due to an increase in DOM concentration with discharge. Thus, low-frequency large events, which are predicted to increase with climate change, are responsible for a signifi cant percentage of annual ter-restrial DOM input to drainage networks. These same events are accompanied by marked and rapid increases in headwater stream velocity; thus they also " shunt " a large proportion of the pulsed DOM to downstream, higher-order rivers and aquatic ecosystems geographically removed from the DOM source of origin. Here we merge these ideas into the " pulse-shunt concept " (PSC) to explain and quantify how infrequent, yet major hydrologic events may drive the timing, fl ux, geographical dispersion, and regional metabolism of terrestrial DOM . The PSC also helps reconcile long-standing discrepancies in C cycling theory and provides a robust framework for better quantifying its highly dynamic role in the global C cycle. The PSC adds a critical temporal dimension to linear organic matter removal dynamics postulated by the river continuum concept. It also can be represented mathematically through a model that is based on stream scaling approaches suitable for quantifying the important role of streams and rivers in the global C cycle. Initial hypotheses generated by the PSC include: (1) Infrequent large storms and snowmelt events account for a large and underap-preciated percentage of the terrestrial DOM fl ux to drainage networks at annual and decadal time scales and therefore event statistics are equally important to total discharge when de-termining terrestrial fl uxes. (2) Episodic hydrologic events result in DOM bypassing headwater streams and being metabolized in large rivers and exported to coastal systems. We propose that the PSC provides a framework for watershed biogeochemical modeling and predictions and discuss implications to ecological processes.},

Nitrogen fixation potential was low across all sites, but lowest in two treated sites (lop  {\&}  scatter and mastication).

abstract = {Many ecological insights into the function of rivers and watersheds emerge from quantifying the flux of solutes or suspended materials in rivers. Numerous methods for flux estimation have been described, and each has its strengths and weaknesses. Currently, the largest practical challenges in flux estimation are to select among these methods and to implement or apply whichever method is chosen. To ease this process of method selection and application, we have written an R software package called loadflex that implements several of the most popular methods for flux estimation, including regressions, interpolations, and the special case of interpolation known as the period-weighted approach. Our package also implements a lesser-known and empirically promising approach called the “composite method,” to which we have added an algorithm for estimating prediction uncertainty. Here we describe the structure and key features of loadflex, with a special emphasis on the rationale and details of our composite method implementation. We then demonstrate the use of loadflex by fitting four different models to nitrate data from the Lamprey River in southeastern New Hampshire, where two large floods in 2006–2007 are hypothesized to have driven a long-term shift in nitrate concentrations and fluxes from the watershed. The models each give believable estimates, and yet they yield different answers for whether and how the floods altered nitrate loads. In general, the best modeling approach for each new dataset will depend on the specific site and solute of interest, and researchers need to make an informed choice among the many possible models. Our package addresses this need by making it simple to apply and compare multiple load estimation models, ultimately allowing researchers to estimate riverine concentrations and fluxes with greater ease and accuracy.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 American Chemical Society. Mountaintop removal coal mining (MTM) is a form of surface mining where ridges and mountain tops are removed with explosives to access underlying coal seams. The crushed rock material is subsequently deposited in headwater valley fills (VF). We examined how this added water storage potential affects streamflow using a paired watershed approach consisting of two sets of mined and unmined watersheds in West Virginia. The mined watersheds exported 7-11{\%} more water than the reference watersheds, primarily due to higher and more sustained baseflows. The mined watersheds exported only {\~{}}1/3 of their streamflow during storms, while the reference watersheds exported {\~{}}2/3 of their annual water yield during runoff events. Mined watersheds with valley fills appear to store precipitation for considerable periods of time and steadily export this alkaline and saline water even during the dry periods of the year. As a result, MTMVFs in a mixed mined/unmined watershed contributed disproportionately to streamflow during baseflow periods (up to  {\textgreater} 90{\%} of flow). Because MTMVFs have both elevated summer baseflows and continuously high concentrations of total dissolved solids, their regional impact on water quantity and quality will be most extreme and most widespread during low flow periods.},

abstract = {Melt ponds play a significant role in the summer decay of sea ice due to the fact that their albedo is significantly lower than surrounding snow and sea ice surface. Despite its requirement for thermodynamic sea ice modeling, measurement of melt pond areal coverage using satellite remote sensing has proven difficult due to significant spatiotemporal variability in the timing and evolution of melt ponds. Less than optimal results from prior studies employing a spectral mixture analysis (SMA) towards the determination of melt pond areal coverage from satellite remote sensing data provided the incentive for a multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA) approach. The MESMA was performed on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery using endmember spectra obtained from atmospherically corrected coincident high resolution imagery, surface observations and modeling. Results were validated against a high resolution Quickbird image acquired coincident to the MODIS image. The validation indicates that the best MESMA results provide consistent estimates of melt pond coverage for regions with high pond coverage (within 5{\%} melt pond coverage) but overestimate pond fraction for regions with low pond coverage (by 10{\%} or more). This may be due to deficiencies in the representation of sea ice surfaces within the endmember library used, oversimplified modeling of the ice surface and shortcomings in the validation process. However, it is assumed that with further refinement, the MESMA technique could allow for reliable estimates of the areal coverage of sea ice melt ponds using low resolution (large spatial coverage) optical satellite imagery under a wide variety of spatiotemporal pond evolution and fraction conditions.},

abstract = {Coal-mine development is occurring at a rapid rate in the central Appalachians, but few tools exist to assess the consequences of cumulative effects of mining to downstream aquatic resources. We constructed and applied an index of mining intensity (MI) to the Lower Cheat River basin, northern West Virginia. Our objectives were to: 1) determine if the MI could be used to predict stream-water quality and biological conditions, 2) quantify the extent to which geology and the geographic position of mines modulate the effects of mining on in-stream conditions, and 3) identify thresholds of MI that produce quantifiable changes to benthic macroinvertebrate communities. We quantified water chemistry, habitat quality, and benthic macroinvertebrate communities from May 2002 to May 2003 in 39 stream segments randomly distributed across a range of MI, coal geology, elevation, and watershed area. We sampled benthic macroinvertebrates at an additional 41 validation sites in May 2002. The MI was positively correlated with dissolved metals (r = 0.65-0.85) and negatively correlated with ecological condition metrics (r = 0.49-0.78), including total richness, Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera richness, and the West Virginia Stream Condition Index. Coal geology and distance from mining had a significant interactive effect on benthic macroinvertebrate responses. Streams draining watersheds with Freeport coal geology had significantly poorer water quality and ecological condition than streams draining watersheds with similar MI but with Kittanning coal geology. Mining effects on stream conditions diminished as distance from the nearest mining activities upstream increased to a distance of similar to 10 km. Changepoint analysis provided evidence of threshold effects of mining on benthic macroinvertebrate communities in Freeport coal watersheds but not in Kittanning coal watersheds. Abrupt reductions in ecological condition occurred at MI values as low as 1 to 5{\%} of maximum intensity, and ecological impairment to streams became almost certain at MI {\textgreater}18 to 20{\%}. Our results provide evidence of an interactive effect of landuse intensity, underlying geology, and the spatial arrangement of disturbance on the degree of impairment to receiving water bodies. The thresholds we identified could be used by water-resource managers to protect and restore stream conditions in actively mined watersheds of the central Appalachian region.},

An assumption underlying this practice is that such created wetlands will replace the ecological functions lost when the developed wetland was destroyed. Part of this ecological function is providing habitat for wildlife, including, in coastal areas, a suite of bird species tied to salt marshes for some portion of their life cycle. We tested the hypothesis that created wetlands provide habitat for the avian communities lost when wetlands are destroyed by comparing the breeding and wintering birds on I I small created salt marshes with those on I I natural reference salt marshes that were carefully matched for size and surrounding land cover. We found that, during the breeding season, created salt marshes had lower avian abundance and richness than reference salt marshes. In particular, wetland-dependent species were poorly represented on created wetlands. On the other hand, bird use outside of the breeding season and use by an important salt marsh obligate species, the clapper rail (Rallus longirostris), did not differ. Created wetlands that we surveyed failed to completely replicate the bird and plant communities that we observed on nearby natural reference salt marshes, raising the question of whether current mitigation policies that encourage wetland creation should continue without further investigation into the success of such wetlands at recreating wildlife habitat.},

Such systems are driven by variable responses of nutrients and organisms to a suite of global and regional factors (eg climate, human social systems) interacting with finer-scale variations in geo- logy, topography, and human modifications. We hypothesize that spatial heterogeneity, connectivity, and asyn- chrony among these patches regulate ecological dynamics of whole networks, altering system sensitivity, resis- tance, and resilience. Long-distance connections between patches may be particularly important in riverine macrosystems, shaping fundamental system properties. Furthermore, the type, extent, intensity, and spatial configuration of human activities (eg land-use change, dam construction) influence watershed-wide ecological properties through effects on habitat heterogeneity and connectivity at multiple scales. Thus, riverine macrosystems are coupled social–ecological systems with feedbacks that influence system responses to environ- mental change and the sustainable delivery of ecosystem services.},

abstract = {Microbial community composition and diversity change along chemical gradients, leading to the expectation that microbial community information might provide new gradient characterizations. Here we examine stream bacteria composition and diversity along a strong chemical gradient in Central Appalachian streams. Coal mining in the region generates alkaline mine drainage (AlkMD), causing dramatic increases in conductivity, alkalinity, sulfate and metals sufficient to degrade stream macrobiota communities throughout the ecoregion. In this study, we examined the relationship between water and biofilm chemistry and biofilm bacteria taxonomic composition in streams where active and reclaimed surface coal mines occupied 0-96{\%} of watershed surface area. We incubated wood veneers in each stream site for 4 months to develop biofilms on similar substrates. We sampled water chemistry at the time of deployment and collection, and after 1 month. Following incubation, we collected biofilms for microbial and chemical characterization. Microbial composition was determined by pyrosequencing 16S rRNA amplicons. Biofilm subsamples were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry to determine metal concentrations. Our results show that microbial community composition differed significantly between AlkMD-exposed and AlkMD-unexposed sites, and that compositional dissimilarity increased with AlkMD loading. Diversity was not correlated with pH or extent of upstream mining, but instead correlated with biofilm concentrations of Cd, Mn, Zn and Ni. Within mined sites, the extent of upstream mining was negatively correlated with taxonomic richness. Despite major compositional shifts, functional capacity predicted with PICRUSt (Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States) correlated with mining in only 3 of 43 level-2 KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) Orthology groups.},

abstract = {The European Space Agency's Sentinel-2A mission with the MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) onboard was launched in 2015, initiating a new era in high-to-moderate-resolution (i.e., 10 to 60 m) imaging of Earth's resources. This manuscript describes the implementations of MSI processing into the SeaWiFS Data Analysis System (SeaDAS) and provides qualitative and quantitative analyses of remote sensing reflectance products (Rrs), which are essential in the retrievals of near-surface concentrations of water constituents in aquatic systems. In situ validations and intercomparisons of MSI-derived Rrs products with those derived from Landsat-8's Operational Land Imager (OLI) both indicated reasonable products in coastal/inland waters. Following vicarious calibrations using reference in situ water-leaving radiances, the overall absolute relative differences and the root mean squared differences (RMSD) found for the matchup analyses were, {\textless} 7{\%} and {\textless} 0.0012 1/sr, respectively, for the blue and green bands. With preliminary indications of consistency with the OLI products and very good agreements with in situ data, a time-series plot of total suspended solids (TSS) product derived from both missions was produced and analyzed for an inland system. It is surmised that frequent moderate-to-high resolution Rrs products from the combined Sentinel-2A (and B) and Landsat-8 missions are now available to the science/user community for developing algorithms suited for coastal/inland waters. Nonetheless, further research needs to be dedicated to a) improving atmospheric corrections over bodies of waters rich in dissolved organic matter or suspended particles, b) mitigating the impact of haze- or sea surface-reflected solar radiations at low solar zenith angles, and c) minimizing image artifacts to maximize the use of multi-mission products.},

We argue that design is a common ground for scientists and practitioners to bring scientific knowl- edge into decision making about landscape change, and we therefore propose that the pattern–process paradigm should be extended to include a third part: design. In this context, we define design as any intentional change of landscape pattern for the purpose of sustainably providing ecosystem services while recognizably meeting societal needs and respecting societal values. We see both the activity of design and the resulting design pattern as oppor- tunities for science: as a research method and as topic of research. To place design within landscape ecol- ogy science, we develop an analytic framework based on the concept of knowledge innovation, and we apply the framework to two cases in which design has been used as part of science.

abstract = {The cross wavelet transform (XWT) is a powerful tool for testing the proposed connections between two time series. Because of XWT's skeletal structure, which is based on the wavelet transform, it is suitable for the analysis of non-stationary periodic signals. Recent work has shown that the power spectrum based on the wavelet transform can produce a deviation, which can be corrected by choosing a proper rectification scale. In this study, we show that the standard application of the XWT can also lead to a biased result. A corrected version of the standard XWT was constructed using the scale of each series as normalizing factors. This correction was first tested in an artificial example involving two series build from combinations of two harmonic series of different amplitudes and frequencies. The standard XWT applied to this example produce a biased result, whereas the correct result is obtained with used of the proposed normalization. This analysis was then applied to a real geophysical situation with important implications to climate modulation on the northwestern Brazilian coast. The linkage between the relative humidity and the shortwave radiation measurements, obtained from the 8°S 30°W ATLAS buoy of the Southwestern Extension of the Prediction and Research moored Array in the Tropical Atlantic Project (PIRATA-SWE), was explored. The analysis revealed the importance of including the correction in order to not overlook any possible connections. The requirements of incorporating this correction in the XWT calculations are emphasized.},

abstract = {This paper examines the patterns of sediment transport in rivers in terms of the sources of sediment and its transport and deposition through the river network. The analysis is in the context of dramatic human influences on river sediment transport and how they might influence freshwater ecosystems. The review of Australian work shows that erosion of hillslopes and stream banks has greatly increased in historical times, supplying vast quantities of sediment to rivers, much of which is still stored within the river system. The stored sediment will continue to effect in-stream and estuarine ecosystems for many decades. In most Australian catchments the dominant source of sediment is streambank erosion. An analysis of historical channel widening suggests that a conceptual framework of relative stream power can explain the diversity of behaviour observed in the numerous case studies. Sediment delivery through catchments is considered first in a generic whole network sense, which emphasizes the crucial role played by riverine deposition in determining catchment sediment budgets. A method is then presented for analysing the diverse spatial patterns of sediment storage in any river network. Finally, the paper considers the temporal changes to channel morphology in response to a human- induced pulse of sediment},

abstract = {Surface coal mining results in dramatic alterations of the landscape in central Appalachia, leading to a myriad of environmental problems. In this study, we explore the long-term effects of surface coal mining on stream chemistry and endeavor to gain a better understanding of the efficacy of reclamation. We examined 30 sites in the Raccoon Creek watershed in southeastern Ohio, where the majority of surface mine sites are in various stages of reclamation. Our results show that conductivity (r = 0.862; P = 0.000), sulfate (r = 0.619; P = 0.000), and aluminum (r = 0.469; P = 0.009) levels increase linearly as a function of the areal extent of reclaimed mines in each subwatershed, suggesting limited success of reclamation to restore natural stream chemistry. In contrast, pH was not significantly linearly correlated with the areal extent of surface mines. This suggests that local acid mine drainage remediation projects are able to regulate acidity levels in the watershed but not conductivity and certain heavy metal concentrations. Many sites had conductivity levels high enough to impair aquatic biota via ionic and osmoregulatory stress. In sum, surface coal mining appears to have a strong legacy effect on stream chemistry in the Raccoon Creek watershed. {\&}copy; 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract = {Energy-flow studies in many terrestrial ecosystems have been characterized by emphasis on grazing pathways. In this paper, we demonstrate the preponderance of energy-flow in detrital-saprophagic pathways, even in those systems exploited for grazing by man (e.g., grassland ecosystems). When examining a full spectrum of terrestrial ecosystem types, ranging from agro-ecosystems to herbaceous to forested ecosystems, the costs for belowground primary (root) production and maintenance are high, and predominate in several natural ecosystems studied so far. Surprisingly, agro-ecosystems remain the ecological units we know the least about, for total-system energy-flow. Making a few estimates of more realistic heterotrophic energy costs, we suggest P/R ratios for highly productive ecosystems may be {\textless}2 (1.8-2.0), and closer than had been previously claimed to some man-managed ecosystems, which have P/R ratios of from 1.2 to 1.3. Because total-system energy budgets are known for so few habitats, many more studies are needed for the developing science of ecosystem management. {\textcopyright} 1976.},

We also describe their role as seed and egg banks for aquatic biota, as dispersal corridors and temporal ecotones linking wet and dry phases, and as sites for the storage and processing of organic matter and nutrients. In light of these valuable functions, dry riverbeds need to be fully integrated into river management policies and monitoring programs.

abstract = {Microbial nitrification and denitrification both can emit nitrous oxide (N2O), a major greenhouse gas, and the relative contribution of each pathway depends strongly on soil moisture conditions. We conducted a stable isotope tracer experiment to determine the contribution of nitrification and denitrification to N2O and dinitrogen (N2) fluxes in coastal plain wetlands, and to determine the response of these processes to changing soil moisture. We added 15N-labeled nitrate (NO3-) or ammonium (NH4+) to intact soil cores collected from an agricultural field, a restored wetland, and a preserved forested wetland, and subjected the cores to a drying or wetting hydrologic manipulation. Across all soils and treatments, the combined fluxes of N2O and N2 ranged widely, between 0.23 and 2900 $\mu$g N m-2 h-1, and N2O accounted for as little as 0{\%} to as much as 43{\%} of the total gaseous nitrogen (N) fluxes. Fluxes of both gases increased with increasing soil moisture in all soils and tracer treatments, but the relative enhancement of the two gases varied by soil type and N source. The N2O yields [N2O/(N2O + N2)] derived from both nitrification and denitrification were low (1-3{\%}) in five of eight soils in each tracer experiment. Surprisingly, nitrification-derived N2O yields were highest (13-31{\%}) in soils with the highest organic matter and soil moisture (restored wetland under simulated rain and forested wetland under drained and simulated rain), while denitrification-derived N2O yields (12-36{\%}) were highest under simulated rain in the two mineral soils (agricultural field and mineral soils of the restored wetland), and under drained conditions in the forested wetland. These results are consistent with field-measured N2O fluxes in our previous work in these sites. We suggest that nitrification plays an important and underappreciated role in contributing to N2O fluxes from freshwater wetlands with often-saturated, acid-organic soils, while incomplete denitrification is the likely source of N2O following rain events in agricultural soils in southeastern U.S. coastal plain wetlands. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

The contribution of sulfuric acid as a weathering agent is still poorly quantified; the identification of riverine sulfate sources is difficult. The use of {\&}delta;{\textless}sup{\textgreater}18{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}O and {\&}delta;{\textless}sup{\textgreater}18{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}O of dissolved sulfate allows us to demonstrate that most of the sulfate in surface waters of the Mackenzie River system, Canada, derives from pyrite oxidation (85{\%} {\&}plusmn; 5{\%}) and not from sedimentary sulfate. The calculated flux of pyrite-derived sulfate is 0.13 {\&}times; 10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}12{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} mol/yr, corresponding to 20{\%}-27{\%} of the estimated global budget. This result suggests that the modern global ocean delivery of sulfide-derived sulfate, and thus chemical weathering with sulfuric acid, may be significantly underestimated. A strong correlation between sulfide oxidation rates and mechanical erosion rates suggests that the exposure of fresh mineral surfaces is the rate-limiting factor of sulfide oxidation in the subbasins investigated. The chemical weathering budget of the Mackenzie River shows that more than half of the dissolved inorganic carbon discharged to the ocean is ancient sedimentary carbon from carbonate (62{\%}) and not atmospheric carbon (38{\%}). The subsequent carbonate precipitation in the ocean will thus release more CO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} in the atmosphere-ocean system than that consumed by continental weathering, typically on glacial-interglacial time scales. {\&}copy; 2007 The Geological Society of America.},

abstract = {Quantification of harmful nitrous oxide (N(2)O) emissions from soils is essential for mitigation measures. An important N(2)O producing and reducing process in soils is denitrification, which shows deceased rates at low pH. No clear relationship between N(2)O emissions and soil pH has yet been established because also the relative contribution of N(2)O as the denitrification end product decreases with pH. Our aim was to show the net effect of soil pH on N(2)O production and emission. Therefore, experiments were designed to investigate the effects of pH on NO(3)(-) reduction, N(2)O production and reduction and N(2) production in incubations with pH values set between 4 and 7. Furthermore, field measurements of soil pH and N(2)O emissions were carried out. In incubations, NO(3)(-) reduction and N(2) production rates increased with pH and net N(2)O production rate was highest at pH 5. N(2)O reduction to N(2) was halted until NO(3)(-) was depleted at low pH values, resulting in a built up of N(2)O. As a consequence, N(2)O:N(2) production ratio decreased exponentially with pH. N(2)O reduction appeared therefore more important than N(2)O production in explaining net N(2)O production rates. In the field, a negative exponential relationship for soil pH against N(2)O emissions was observed. Soil pH could therefore be used as a predictive tool for average N(2)O emissions in the studied ecosystem. The occurrence of low pH spots may explain N(2)O emission hotspot occurrence. Future studies should focus on the mechanism behind small scale soil pH variability and the effect of manipulating the pH of soils.},

abstract = {We introduce a framework - based on experiences from oceanic islands - for conserving biodiversity in the Anthropocene. In an increasingly human-dominated world, the context for conservation-oriented action is extremely variable, attributable to three largely independent factors: the degree of anthropogenic change, the importance of deliberate versus inadvertent human influence on ecosystems, and land-use priorities. Given this variability, we discuss the need to integrate four strategies, often considered incompatible, for safeguarding biodiversity: maintaining relicts of historical biodiversity through intensive and continuous management; creating artificial in situ, inter situ, and ex situ conservation settings that are resilient to anthropogenic change; co-opting novel ecosystems and associated "opportunistic biodiversity" as the wildlands of the future; and promoting biodiversity in cultural landscapes by adapting economic activities. {\textcopyright} The Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {Large-scale surface mining in southern West Virginia significantly alters headwater stream networks. The extent to which mining interacts with other stressors to determine physical, chemical, and biological conditions in aquatic systems downstream is unclear. We conducted a watershed-scale assessment of Pigeon Creek, an intensively mined watershed of the Tug Fork drainage in Mingo County, West Virginia. Our objectives were to: 1) develop landscape-based indicators of mining and residential development, 2) quantify the interactive effects of mining and residential development on in-stream conditions, and 3) identify landscape-based thresholds above which biological impairment occurs in this watershed. Macroinvertebrate community structure was negatively correlated with intensity of mining and residential development. Correlation analysis and partial Mantel tests indicated that mining ({\%} of total subwatershed area) caused acute changes in water chemistry (r = 0.55-0.91), whereas residential development (parcel density) strongly affected both physical habitat (r = 0.59-0.81) and macroinvertebrate community structure (r = 0.59-0.93). The combined effects of mining and development on in-stream biotic conditions were additive. Sites affected by equivalent levels of both stressors had lower Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera richness than sites affected by either stressor alone. Biological impairment thresholds occurred at similar to 25{\%} total mining (equivalent to a specific conductance of similar to 250 mu S/cm) and at parcel densities of similar to 5 and 14 parcels/km(2). Our results provide a tool that can be used to predict downstream ecological response to proposed mining given pre-existing watershed conditions. Our study suggests that effective management of impacts from new mine development must address nonmining-related impacts in this region.},

Before holistic stream restoration could properly start, however, it was stopped in its tracks by two big issues: were the far more intensive interventions necessary to holistic restoration actually doable; and was it possible to reconcile the ecological goals of setting streams and rivers free with the powerful economic demands to minimize impacts from flooding and erosion? Taken together, these two issue called the whole project of stream restoration into doubt. But then a consultant, Dave Rosgen, stepped up with a restoration approach that promised both freedom and constraint: picturesque rivers teaming with game fish in a channel that stayed where it was put. Drawing on the sociology of expectations literature within STS, I argue that it was the expectations raised by this apparent resolution of the contradiction at the heart of stream restoration that transformed both Rosgen and the restoration field from shaky prospects into contenders, setting the stage for the exponential growth of stream restoration, and Rosgen's success within in it. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Ecosystems provide a wide range of services to society. Some forms of use affect the quality of the ecosystem, reducing its value for other users. This leads to a conflict of interest that is often settled through political processes, resulting in some form of regulation. We link theory on ecosystem response to theories from the socioeconomic branches of science to analyze the mechanisms behind two widespread problems associated with such political solutions. First, they often represent a compromise rather than an integrative solution. We demonstrate that, particularly in sensitive ecosystems, integrative solutions yield a higher average social utility and imply a higher ecosystem quality. Integrative solutions require insight into ecosystems responses to different forms of use and a complete overview of ecosystem services to society. Second, there is a systematic bias away from optimal shared use toward activities that are detrimental to ecosystem quality. This bias arises from the fact that utilities depending on ecosystem quality are often shared by large diffuse groups, whereas pollution and harvesting activities can usually be traced to relatively small and well-organized groups. Theory and data indicate that this type of concentrated group is systematically better at mustering political power than large groups, which find it difficult to realize collective action due to what is known in game theory as "free-rider problems. Our analysis suggests that the following three key ingredients are needed to correct the problems of bias and compromise: (a) clear insight into ecosystem dynamic responses to human use, (b) a broad inventory of credible measurements of ecosystem utilities, (c) avoidance of bias due to differences in the organizational power of groups of stakeholders. We argue that good ecosystem models, institutionalized ecosystem valuation, and innovative tax-setting schedules are essential to achieving a socially fair and sustainable use of ecosystems by societies. In addition, we highlight the fact that many environmental problems remain unresolved for a long time and briefly identify the social mechanisms responsible for this delay.},

In this paper, newly compiled data on the 60 largest rivers of the world are used to calculate the contribution of main lithologies, rain and atmosphere to river dissolved loads. Technically, an inverse method is used to solve a model containing of a series of mass budget equations relating river concentrations to chemical weathering products and atmospheric inputs. New estimates of global silicate weathering fluxes and associated CO2 consumption fluxes are given. The role of basalt weathering on oceanic islands and volcanic arcs is emphasized. For each large river, an attempt is made to calculate chemical weathering rates of silicates per unit area. Only relative chemical weathering rates can be calculated. The relationships between the chemical weathering rates of silicates and the possible controlling parameters are explored. A combined effect of runoff-temperature and physical denudation seems to explain the variability of modern silicate chemical weathering rates. The results of this study highlight the coupling between the physical and the chemical processes of silicate weathering. Only an active physical denudation of continental rocks seems to be able to maintain high chemical weathering rates and significant CO2 consumption rates.},

abstract = {The study of a sample of river sediment enables the determination of spatially averaged denudation rates that provide an exceptional perspective on erosion and weathering processes that have taken place within a landscape. These measurements are done with in-situ produced cosmogenic nuclides (e.g. 10Be, 26Al), mostly in quartz from alluvial sediment. Cosmogenic nuclides are produced when secondary cosmic rays interact with the very uppermost layer of the Earth's surface. They are produced within a characteristic depth scale of about 1 m, which means that the measured concentrations record an integrated denudation history while material passed through this depth interval. Depending on the denudation rate the resulting integration time scales are 103 to 105 years, and one obtains a robust long-term estimate of natural denudation that is relatively insensitive to short-term changes. The last 10 years have seen significant research activity using these methods, and an array of fascinating tectono-geomorphologic and geochemical insights are emerging. Amongst these is the ability to identify the physical and chemical processes with which a landscape responds to tectonic activity or climate change. A compilation of world-wide denudation rates in non-glaciated areas, that however, does not yet include some of the world's most active mountain belts, has resulted in the following findings, some of which have been unexpected: (1) No obvious relationship between precipitation or mean annual temperature and total denudation is apparent. (2) Topographic relief alone does not result in high rates of denudation. (3) Denudation rates are high in areas of landscape rejuvenation; that is triggered and controlled by tectonic activity (faulting, escarpment formation and retreat, rifting, surface uplift). (4) Rates of weathering (using a combination of cosmogenic nuclides and zirconium-normalised cation loss balances) co-vary primarily with physical erosion rates and much less with temperature or precipitation. (5) In some areas of high land use short-term rates (from river load gauging) exceed those from cosmogenic nuclides by several orders of magnitude, which serves to highlight the severity of geomorphic change caused by human action. In the future, the control mechanisms over denudation will be determined on all spatial scales, ranging from the single soil section to entire river basins. The same analysis can be done back through time on well-dated terraces, lake records, and marine sediment cores, which is possible with 10Be for the past 1-2 My. The rates obtained will be used to develop a quantitative understanding of tectonic, geomorphologic, and geochemical landscape processes, which in turn is a prerequisite to design and calibrate models of the response of landscapes to tectonic, climate, and anthropogenic forcing. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

These substances are derived from rocks, sediments, and other natural repositories, and most undergo transformation prior to use. A large fraction of the materials is eventually returned to the environment. Natural processes do the same but not necessarily with the same suite of materials. For purposes of better understanding industrial development and potential environmental impact, it is important to know, even approximately, the elemental cycles of all materials potentially useful for modern technology. In this review, we examine and summarize cycle information for 77 of the first 92 elements in the periodic table. Mobilization calculations demonstrate that human activities likely dominate or strongly perturb the cycles of most of the elements other than the alkalis, alkali earths, and halogens. We propose that this pattern is ultimately related to the aqueous solubilities of the predominant chemical forms ...},

abstract = {Dissolved and suspended loads of the main streams on the island of R{\'{e}}union have been analysed for their major and trace element contents in order to characterise both chemical and mechanical erosion products. The chemical composition of R{\'{e}}union surface waters is controlled by partial dissolution of the basaltic rocks they interact with, by atmospheric input and, in some cases, by thermal spring inflow. The elemental contributions arising from these three processes have been calculated using typical concentration ratios for each endmember. The contribution from oceanic type rains is important for Cl and Na and minor for Mg, Ca, K, and Sr. Some thermal springs join their nearest rivers in Piton des Neiges calderas and influence the sulphate, Li, and B concentrations, and to a lesser extent Ca, Sr, and Rb. For all the rivers that are not affected by the thermal springs, the contribution from basalt weathering is higher than 70{\%} of the total dissolved solids. The chemical composition of the suspended load in R{\'{e}}union rivers reflects a low weathering state for basalt in each drainage basin, implying that mechanical erosion is more important than chemical erosion. Assuming a steady-state between these two complementary erosion processes, we propose a mass budget between the dissolved and suspended erosion products and the local unweathered basalt for each of the main river catchments. Given the lack of reliable long-term measurements of river suspended load at R{\'{e}}union, this mass budget enables us to calculate the suspended load concentration that is required to counterbalance the concentration of total dissolved solids due to chemical weathering. The calculated suspended load concentration is much higher than that measured which implies that equilibrium between mechanical and chemical erosion was not attained at the time of sampling. However, we suggest that in such a tropical climate, most of the suspended load will be carried during cyclonic events, these short periods of time providing about 50{\%} of the annual amount of river water. Thus, erosional steady-state must be achieved on the scale of the annual hydrologic cycle. From the total dissolved solid concentrations induced by basalt weathering, and given the annual discharge from R{\'{e}}union rivers, we infer specific chemical erosion rates of 63-170 t/km2/yr and specific atmospheric CO2 consumption rates, during basalt erosion, of 1.3-4.4 × 106 mol/km2/yr. Mechanical erosion rates deduced from the calculated suspended load concentrations range from 1200 to 9100 t/ km2/yr. Total erosion (chemical plus mechanical) give basalt denudation rates of 470-3430 mm/kyr. All these erosion rates (chemical, mechanical, total, and atmospheric CO2 consumption) are among the highest global estimates and are due to high runoff, steep slopes, active volcanics, and related active tectonics, and young basaltic lithologies, which characterise R{\'{e}}union.},

This much-needed publication, which includes contributions from leading researchers and practitioners, presents a holistic perspective on the restoration of wetland ecosystems such as shallow lakes, streams, floodplains and bogs. Through the use of carefully chosen case studies, the authors examine European wetland restoration projects from Scandinavia to Bulgaria and from Ireland to Belarus, focusing on the lessons they can teach to a new generation of conservationists. As well as reviewing the sum of current knowledge on the subject, the text is a store of practical know-how, covering a wide range of conservation approaches and techniques. It analyzes the major problems in the field and identifies key principles for achieving sustainability in wetland restoration. The topics covered include: • the role of wetlands in landscape functioning • human interference with natural processes such as water and matter cycles and energy dissipation • the impact of land use on global problems such as climate change, floods and droughts • the role played by diversity in wetland functioning The work shows that without sustainable land use over the totality of their catchment areas, and without cohesive inter-agency cooperation, individual restoration projects will have a short life span. The balance between scientific background and practical restoration makes this book a valuable resource for scientists as well as wetland managers, decision makers and land use planners, as well as students of ecology, nature conservation and environmental protection.},

abstract = {An age-old conflict around a seemingly simple question has resurfaced: why do we conserve nature? Contention around this issue has come and gone many times, but in the past several years we believe that it has reappeared as an increasingly acrimonious debate between, in essence, those who argue that nature should be protected for its own sake (intrinsic value)and those who argue that we must also save nature to help ourselves (instrumental value). Champions of instrumental value contend, among other things, that protecting nature for its own sake alone has failed to stem the tide of species extinction, that conservation should be open to partnering with business to effect the greatest change and that conservation support will be broadened by more directly considering other social objectives (such as food security or clean water). By contrast, advocates of intrinsic value assert that ethical arguments for conservation should be sufficient, that partnering with business is selling out to those who create the problem and that social considerations are already central to conservation.},

abstract = {We analyzed nutrient data from a probability survey of 1392 wadeable streams across the 48 conterminous states of the US and from intensified survey data in 921 streams in the Pacific Northwest (PNW) to examine different methods of setting nutrient criteria and to develop a nutrient stream typology. We calculated potential nutrient criteria for total P (TP) and total N (TN) by 3 methods (ecoregion population 25th percentile of population, least-disturbed reference-site 75th percentile, and disturbance modeling) and compared them with existing draft US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) criteria within 14 national nutrient ecoregions. All criteria derived from the methods were highly correlated; however, absolute values within ecoregions differed greatly among approaches. Population 25th percentiles of TP were almost always lower from statistically designed survey data than from found data. TN percentiles were more similar than were TP profiles, but they still tended to be lower from survey data than from found data. TP and TN population 25th percentiles were lower (often by a factor of 2–6) than referencesite 75th percentiles in all ecoregions. This result indicates that population 25th percentiles cannot be used as surrogates for reference-site 75th percentiles. Thirty-nine percent of the assessed national stream length exceeded TP criteria and 47{\%} exceeded TN criteria when compared to nutrient criteria based on EPA Wadeable Stream Assessment reference-site 75th percentiles. In the PNW data set, all disturbance regression model estimates of background nutrient concentrations were lower than reference-site 75th percentiles. Regression tree analysis based on PNW reference sites used runoff, elevation, acid neutralizing capacity, forest composition, substrate size, and Omernik level III ecoregion as environmental class predictors to explain 46 to 48{\%} of the total deviance in nutrient concentration. Reference-site nutrient concentrations varied widely among Omernik level III ecoregions in nutrient ecoregion II. Our analysis and the literature strongly suggest that 14 national nutrient ecoregions are too coarse to account for natural variation in stream nutrient concentrations. Setting appropriate national nutrient criteria will require finer-scale typology or classification of sites that better controls for natural variation.},

abstract = {Mountaintop removal mining is a dominant driver of land use/land cover changes in the Appalachian Region of the eastern United States and is expected to increase in scale in the coming decades. While several studies quantify land use/land cover changes attributed to traditional surface mining and at regional scales, no studies we are aware of focus specifically on mountaintop removal/valley fill mining practices at the watershed scale. Further, despite its scale and extent, its impact on runoff, particularly at larger spatial scales (103 km2), is poorly understood due to the complex relationships between climate, land use, and hydrology. To explore the impacts of this practice at broader scales, we estimated land use/land cover changes using Landsat 5 TM imagery over five periods between 1994 and 2010; used a simple rainfall-runoff model to estimate hydrologic response time; and conducted non-parametric trend analyses on annual hydrologic metrics (streamflow, Q/P, response time) for the Big Coal River watershed located in the southern West Virginia coalfields. No statistically significant trends were detected in any of the timeseries. The lack of detectable trends and correlations between land use changes and hydrology at the basin scale are not entirely unexpected due to the history and mosaic of land cover changes that span timescales larger than our study period. Further interannual variation likely overwhelms our ability to detect potential changes using monotonic trend analysis at the annual time scale, particularly in light of strong streamflow seasonality. Future studies therefore should include different methods of change detection applied to different timescales to more appropriately account seasonal and interannual variations. Until the significance of this practice on water resources (quality and quality) are understood, efforts to reduce the environmental problems associated with mountaintop mining will be difficult to achieve. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Climate change creates new challenges for biodiversity conservation. Species ranges and ecological dynamics are already responding to recent climate shifts, and current reserves will not continue to support all species they were designed to protect. These problems are exacerbated by other global changes. Scholarly articles recommending measures to adapt conservation to climate change have proliferated over the last 22 years. We systematically reviewed this literature to explore what potential solutions it has identified and what consensus and direction it provides to cope with climate change. Several consistent recommendations emerge for action at diverse spatial scales, requiring leadership by diverse actors. Broadly, adaptation requires improved regional institutional coordination, expanded spatial and temporal perspective, incorporation of climate change scenarios into all planning and action, and greater effort to address multiple threats and global change drivers simultaneously in ways that are responsive to and inclusive of human communities. However, in the case of many recommendations the how, by whom, and under what conditions they can be implemented is not specified. We synthesize recommendations with respect to three likely conservation pathways: regional planning; site-scale management; and modification of existing conservation plans. We identify major gaps, including the need for (1) more specific, operational examples of adaptation principles that are consistent with unavoidable uncertainty about the future; (2) a practical adaptation planning process to guide selection and integration of recommendations into existing policies and programs; and (3) greater integration of social science into an endeavor that, although dominated by ecology, increasingly recommends extension beyond reserves and into human-occupied landscapes. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Such markets trade in ecosystem credits created at restoration sites where conservation projects are designed and built to compensate for regulated environmental impacts. “Credit stacking” occurs when multiple, spatially overlapping credits representing different ecosystem services are sold separately to compensate for different impacts. Discussion of stacking has grown rapidly over the past three years, and it will generate increasing interest given the growing multibillion-dollar international market in carbon, habitat, and water-quality credits.

@article{Mørkved2007b,
abstract = {The contribution of nitrification to the emission of nitrous oxide (N2O) from soils may be large, but its regulation is not well understood. The soil pH appears to play a central role for controlling N2O emissions from soil, partly by affecting the N2O product ratios of both denitrification (N2O/(N2+N2O)) and nitrification (N2O/(NO2
-+NO3
-). Mechanisms responsible for apparently high N2O product ratios of nitrification in acid soils are uncertain. We have investigated the pH regulation of the N2O product ratio of nitrification in a series of experiments with slurries of soils from long-term liming experiments, spanning a pH range from 4.1 to 7.8. 15N labelled nitrate (NO3
-) was added to assess nitrification rates by pool dilution and to distinguish between N2O from NO3
- reduction and NH3 oxidation. Sterilized soil slurries were used to determine the rates of chemodenitrification (i.e. the production of nitric oxide (NO) and N2O from the chemical decomposition of nitrite (NO2
-)) as a function of NO2
- concentrations. Additions of NO2
- to aerobic soil slurries (with 15N labelled NO3
- added) were used to assess its potential for inducing denitrification at aerobic conditions. For soils with pH???5, we found that the N2O product ratios for nitrification were low (0.2-0.9???) and comparable to values found in pure cultures of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria. In mineral soils we found only a minor increase in the N2O product ratio with increasing soil pH, but the effect was so weak that it justifies a constant N2O product ratio of nitrification for N2O emission models. For the soils with pH 4.1 and 4.2, the apparent N2O product ratio of nitrification was 2 orders of magnitude higher than above pH 5 (76??? and 14???). This could partly be accounted for by the rates of chemodenitrification of NO2
-. We further found convincing evidence for NO2
--induction of aerobic denitrification in acid soils. The study underlines the role of NO2
-, both for regulating denitrification and for the apparent nitrifier-derived N2O emission. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Alvarez-Romero2011,
abstract = {Continued loss of biodiversity remains a major international concern on land and in the sea (Rands et al. 2010, Stokstad 2010), and many efforts to curb this decline involve spatial protection through systematic conservation planning (Margules {\&} Pressey 2000). The history of protected areas as a formal conservation tool began on land with the establishment of Yellowstone National Park in 1872. The first marine protected area (MPA) was designated in Australia in 1879, but the pace of efforts in the sea has lagged that of those on land by several decades. Because conservation efforts were more prevalent on land, marine conservation science was built on a rich history of terrestrial theory and application (Kirkpatrick 1983, Margules {\&} Pressey 2000). Although there are key differences in marine systems that require adaptation of terrestrial approaches (e.g., different scales and patterns of dispersal as well as different types of threats; Halpern et al. 2008, Kinlan {\&} Gaines 2003), the foundation of planning principles on land has played a pivotal role in the rapid advancement of marine conservation planning. Despite shared conceptual roots, conservation planning in terrestrial and marine realms has largely proceeded as if the ecological systems were unconnected (Beck 2003, Stoms et al. 2005). This lack of integration is especially problematic in the sea because the physical and ecological connections between land and sea are often highly asymmetrical; marine areas are often more influenced by land than vice versa (Stoms et al. 2005). MPAs designed to protect marine biodi- versity (Wood et al. 2008) are vulnerable to both land- and sea-based threats originating outside their boundaries (Boersma {\&} Parrish 1999, Cicin-Sain {\&} Belfiore 2005). Because most MPAs are in coastal waters (Wood et al. 2008), the risks from diverse land-based activities are further accentuated (Halpern et al. 2009). In this review, we examine our understanding of the connec- tions between land and ocean systems as well as how these connections should guide integrated conservation design and implementation of conservation actions. Conservation planning focuses on the spatial allocation of conservation resources to different actions (e.g., protected areas, restoration sites, managed harvesting, and best-practice land use; Sarkar et al. 2006), which is complemented by non-spatial activities, such as legislation, policy, incentives, capacity building, and education (Pressey {\&} Bottrill 2009). Such complementary efforts strengthen conservation areas and expand the management and sustainable use of natural resources to areas surrounding or linked to focal conservation areas. Land-sea conservation planning incorporates ecological connections between land and sea and seeks to limit land-based threats to MPAs, but neither a comprehensive review nor an operational framework for land-sea planning exists. Much has been written about integrated coastal zone man- agement and marine ecosystem-based management (see Cicin-Sain {\&} Belfiore 2005, McLeod {\&} Leslie 2009). These approaches often address aspects of land-sea planning such as ecological con- nections between land and sea, cumulative impacts, multiple objectives, diverse stakeholders, and jurisdictional fragmentation. However, neither addresses the fundamental concepts of systematic conservation planning, namely, complementarity between selected areas, least-cost solutions to achieving objectives, and transparent and repeatable methods for designing configurations of con- servation areas (see Margules {\&} Pressey 2000). Ideally, integrated land-sea conservation planning combines systematic principles with aspects of other approaches to delineate conservation areas and to set priorities for action across realms. Beyond the requirements for planning in a single realm (Pressey {\&} Bottrill 2009), land-sea planning should involve explicit conservation objectives for processes that connect the land and the sea as well as explicit ways of accounting for threats that originate in one realm and affect the other. Land-sea planning also addresses the urgent need to effectively integrate conservation investments on land and in the sea to maximize benefits and minimize costs of conservation actions. 382 A ́ lvarez-Romero et al. Annu. Rev. Ecol. Evol. Syst. 2011.42:381-409. Downloaded from www.annualreviews.org by University of Washington on 03/24/14. For personal use only. Some of the conservation implications of connections between land and sea have been examined previously. Beger et al. (2010) assessed the methods, challenges, and potential for spatial analyses to incorporate processes connecting terrestrial, freshwater, and marine environments. Stoms et al. (2005) outlined a conceptual model and methods to incorporate land-sea linkages that either benefit or threaten marine environments. Tallis et al. (2008) explored potential changes to MPA design to account for threats originating on land. Klein et al. (2010) proposed a method to maximize the return on investment in terrestrial and marine conservation actions to minimize threats to coral reefs originating both on land and in the sea. These studies contributed novel concepts and methods to the quickly evolving and highly complex field of land-sea planning. However, none of these papers integrated all the necessary considerations for comprehensive land-sea planning, which is a primary objective of our review. In addition, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and government agencies from around the world have adapted systematic conservation planning to address the practical difficulties of integrating land and sea. Reported mostly in the gray literature, their insights are obscure to the broader conservation community. For the first time, we review their lessons learned and contributions to theory and practice.},

abstract = {1. The provision of environmental flows and the removal of barriers to water flow are high priorities for restoration where changes to flow regimes have caused degradation of riverine ecosystems. Nevertheless, flow regulation is often accompanied by changes in catchment and riparian land-use, which also can have major impacts on river health via local habitat degradation or modification of stream energy regimes. 2. The challenges are determining the relative importance of flow, land-use and other impacts as well as deciding where to focus restoration effort. As a consequence, flow, catchment and riparian restoration efforts are often addressed in isolation. River managers need decision support tools to assess which flow and catchment interventions are most likely to succeed and, importantly, which are cost-effective. 3. Bayesian networks (BNs) can be used as a decision support tool for considering the influence of multiple stressors on aquatic ecosystems and the relative benefits of various restoration options. We provide simple illustrative examples of how BNs can address specific river restoration goals and assist with the prioritisation of flow and catchment restoration options. This includes the use of cost and utility functions to assist decision makers in their choice of potential management interventions. 4. A BN approach facilitates the development of conceptual models of likely cause and effect relationships between flow regime, land-use and river conditions and provides an interactive tool to explore the relative benefits of various restoration options. When combined with information on the costs and expected benefits of intervention, one can derive recommendations about the best restoration option to adopt given the network structure and the associated cost and utility functions.},

abstract = {* While there is an increasing emphasis in terrestrial ecology on determining the influence of the area that surrounds habitat patches (the landscape ‘matrix') relative to the characteristics of the patches themselves, research on these aspects in running waters is still rather underrepresented. * Here we outline conceptual foundations of matrix ecology for stream and river ecosystems (‘riverscapes'). We discuss how a hierarchical, patch-based perspective is necessary for the delineation of habitat patches and the surrounding matrix, through which we may identify two classes of habitat edges in riverscapes (i.e. edges between the terrestrial–aquatic interface and edges within streams). * Under this conceptual framework, we discuss the role of the matrix in influencing between-patch movement, and resource quality and quantity within and among habitat patches in riverscapes. We also review types of empirical and modelling approaches which may advance our understanding of fragmentation effects in these systems. * We identify five key challenges for understanding fragmentation and matrix effects more completely: (i) defining populations and their status (i.e. quantifying the demographic contribution of habitat patches to metapopulation dynamics), (ii) scaling from metapopulations to metacommunities (particularly searching for generalities in species responses to landscape heterogeneity), (iii) scaling from metacommunities to metaecosystems (i.e. exploring the interactive role of the terrestrial–aquatic and within-stream matrix effects on the flow of material and energy at the network scale), (iv) understanding temporal dynamics in matrix permeability and (v) revealing the utility of different patch and matrix representations for modelling connectivity relationships. * Fragmentation of habitats is a critical issue in the conservation and management of stream networks across spatial scales. Although the effects of individual barriers (e.g. dams) are well documented, we argue that a more comprehensive patch–matrix landscape model will improve our understanding of fragmentation effects and improve management in riverscapes.},

Previous research in surface mining environments has focused on downstream water quality impacts, yet little is known about the fundamental controls on Se loading. This study investigated the relationship between mining practices, stream flows and Se concentrations using a SPAtially Referenced Regression On Watershed attributes (SPARROW) model. This work is part of a R{\&}D program examining the influence of surface coal mining on hydrological and water quality responses in the Elk Valley, British Columbia, Canada, aimed at informing effective management responses. Results indicate that waste rock volume, a product of mining activity, accounted for roughly 80{\%} of the Se load from the Elk Valley, while background sources accounted for roughly 13{\%}. Wet years were characterized by more than twice the Se load of dry years. A number of variables regarding placement of waste rock within the catchments, length of buried streams, and the construction of rock drains did not significantly influence the Se load. The age of the waste rock, the proportion of waste rock surface reclaimed, and the ratio of waste rock pile side area to top area all varied inversely with the Se load from watersheds containing waste rock. These results suggest operational practices that are likely to reduce the release of Se to surface waters.},

abstract = {Urban ecology has quickly become established as a central part of ecological thinking. As cities continue to grow in size and number, two questions serve to unify this broad and multidisciplinary research landscape: (1) how can urban ecology contribute to the science of ecology, and (2) how can urban ecology be applied to make cities more livable and sustainable? In spite of the advances made thus far, there are many unexplored ways of integrating the science and application of urban ecology. Although scientists assess and make predictions regarding the connections between environmental and socioeconomic processes, practitioners involved in real-world application deal with urban planning and with designing ecosystem services to improve living con- ditions for all urban inhabitants and to make cities more sustainable. Research in urban ecosystems can be developed from many different perspectives, and we suggest that each perspective has something to offer both society and the science of ecology. We present several research perspectives and describe how these can inte- grate conceptual and applied aspects to bridge the figurative gaps between trees, buildings, and people.},

abstract = {Coal mining activities have been implicated as sources that increase stream-specific conductance in Central Appalachia. The present study characterized potential sources of elevated ionic strength for small subwatersheds within the Coal, Upper Kanawha, Gauley, and New Rivers in West Virginia. From a large monitoring data set developed by the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection, 162 {\textless}20-km(2) -watersheds were found with detailed land cover information in southwestern West Virginia with at least one water chemistry sample. Scatter plots of specific conductance were generated for nine land cover classifications: open water, agriculture, forest, residential, barren, total mining, valley fill, abandoned mine lands, and mining excluding valley fill and abandoned mine lands. Conductivity was negatively correlated with the percentage of forest area and positively associated with other land uses. In a multiple regression, the percentage of area in valley fill was the strongest contributor to increased ionic strength, followed by percentage of area in urban (residential/buildings) land use and other mining land use. Based on the 10th quantile regression, 300 µS/cm was exceeded at 3.3{\%} of area in valley fill. In most catchments, HCO(3) (-) and SO(4) (2-) concentrations were greater than Cl(-) concentration. These findings confirm coal mining activities as the primary source of high conductivity waters. Such activities might be redressed with the goal of protecting sources of dilute freshwater in the region. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. {\textcopyright} 2012 SETAC.},

abstract = {Analysis of subsurface stormflow from 147 storms at the 20 m long trench in the Panola Mountain Research Watershed by Tromp-van Meerveld and McDonnell (2006a) showed that there was a distinct 55 mm precipitation threshold for significant subsurface stormflow production. This second paper in the series investigates the processes responsible for this threshold response.We installed a dense spatial array of maximum rise crest stage gauges and recording wells on the hillslope and studied the temporal and spatial patterns of transient saturation at the soil-bedrock interface and its relation to subsurface stormflow measured at the trench face. Results show that while transient groundwater developed on parts of the hillslope during events smaller than 55 mm, it was not until more than 55 mm of rain fell before bedrock depressions on the hillslope were filled, water spilled over microtopographic relief in the bedrock surface, and the subsurface saturated areas became connected to the trench. When connectivity was achieved, the instantaneous subsurface stormflow rate increased more than fivefold compared to before the subsurface saturated areas were connected to the trench face. Total subsurface stormflow was more than 75 times larger when connectivity was achieved compared to when connectivity was not achieved. The fill and spill hypothesis presented in this paper is a process explanation for the observed threshold behavior of Tromp-van Meerveld and McDonnell (2006a), thereby linking patterns and processes},

abstract = {The classic account of primary succession inferred from a 220-yr glacial retreat chronosequence at Glacier Bay National Park, Alaska was compared to reconstructions of stand development based on tree-ring records from 850 trees at 10 sites of different age. The three oldest sites (deglaciated prior to 1840) differ from all younger sites in the early recruitment of Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis), the presence of western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla), and the inferred importance of early shrub thickets. The nitrogen-fixing shrub Sitka alder (Alnus sinuata) has been an important and long-lived species only at sites deglaciated since 1840. Black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa) has been an overstory dominant only at sites deglaciated since 1900. These single-species additions or replacements distinguish three pathways of vegetation compositional change which are segregated spatially and temporally. The communities of different age at Glacier Bay do not constitute a single chronosequence and should nut be used uncritically to infer long-term successional trends. Among-site differences in texture and lithology of soil parent, material cannot account for the multiple pathways. However, distance from each study site to the closest seed source of Sitka spruce at the time of deglaciation explains up to 58{\%} of the among-site variance in early spruce recruitment. Multiple pathways of compositional change at Glacier Bay appear to be a function of landscape context, which, in conjunction with species life history trails (dispersal capability and generation time), affects seed rain to newly deglaciated surfaces and thereby alters the arrival sequence of species. Differences among the pathways probably include long-term differences in ecosystem function resulting from substantial accumulation of nitrogen at sites where nitrogen-fixing shrubs are important.},

abstract = {Understanding environmental processes begins with mental conceptualizations of system components and interactions. Conceptualizing rivers begins with adopting one of two reference frames for observing movement: Eulerian, wherein the flux of objects is observed in a spatially bounded area, or Lagrangian, wherein specific objects are tracked through time. Mechanistic studies include Eulerian and Lagrangian data, with some negotiation of how much Eulerian and Lagrangian information may be needed to maximize the accuracy of understanding processes and the efficiency of data collection. Most studies rely on a presupposed reference frame, yet we suspect breakthroughs lurk in explicit alterations of presupposed reference frames. We analyze the importance of reference frames by contrasting the extent to which alternative reference frames have been used and combined in studies of sediment transport, fish migration, and river biogeochemistry. We show how adopting alternative or nonintuitive reference frames can facilitate novel research questions and observations, potentially triggering new research trajectories.},

abstract = {Forest succession contributes to the global terrestrial carbon (C) sink, but changes in C sequestration in response to varied harvest intensities have been debated. The forests of the Central Appalachian region have been aggrading over the past 100 years following widespread clear-cutting that occurred in the early 1900s and these forests are now valuable timberlands. This study compared the history of ecosystem C storage in four watersheds that have been harvested at different frequencies and intensities since 1958. We compared NPP, NEP, and component ecosystem C fluxes (g C m-2 year-1) in response to the four different harvest histories (no harvest, clear-cutting, single tree selection cutting, and 43 cm diameter-limit cutting). Clear-cutting had short-term negative effects on NEP but harvest did not significantly impact long-term average annual C sequestration rates. Average plant C (g C m-2) since 1950 was about 33{\%} lower in response to a clear-cut event than plant C in an un-harvested forest, suggesting that the C sequestration associated with clear-cutting practices would decline over time and result in lower C storage than diameter-limit cut, selective cut, or un-harvested forests. Total C stored over a 55-year period was stimulated ???37{\%} with diameter-limit cutting and selective cutting relative to un-harvested forests. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The ecosystem engineering concept focuses on how organisms physically change the abiotic environment and how this feeds back to the biota. While the concept was formally introduced a little more than 10 years ago, the underpinning of the concept can be traced back to more than a century to the early work of Darwin. The formal application of the idea is yielding new insights into the role of species in ecosystems and many other areas of basic and applied ecology. Here we focus on how temporal, spatial and organizational scales usefully inform the roles played by ecosystem engineers and their incorporation into broader ecological contexts. Two particular, distinguishing features of ecosystem engineers are that they affect the physical space in which other species live and their direct effects can last longer than the lifetime of the organism--engineering can in essence outlive the engineer. Together, these factors identify critical considerations that need to be included in models, experimental and observational work. The ecosystem engineering concept holds particular promise in the area of ecological applications, where influence over abiotic variables and their consequent effects on biotic communities may facilitate ecological restoration and counterbalance anthropogenic influences.},

abstract = {Current West Virginia coal mining regulations emphasize reforestation as a preferred postmining land use on surface mined areas. Some mined sites reclaimed to pasture are being converted to forests. In the spring of 2001, we compared the establishment and growth of five hardwood tree species on a reclaimed West Virginaia surface mine with compacted soils and a heavy grass groundcover. We planted 1-yr-old seedlings of five species (black cherry [Prunus serotina Ehrh.], red oak [Quercus rubra L.], yellow poplar [Liriodendron tulipifera L.], black walnut [Juglans nigra L.], and white ash [Fraxinus americana L.]) into sites that were mowed and unmowed on north- and south-facing aspects. We applied a ripping treatment, which loosened the compacted soils and disturbed the heavy ground cover. First year results showed {\textgreater}80{\%} survival for all species. After 7 yr black cherry survival averaged 36{\%}, red oak 47{\%}, yellow poplar 66{\%}, black walnut 80{\%}, and white ash 98{\%} across all sites and treatments. Seedling survival was best on north, unmowed, and ripped areas. Average growth (height x diameter(2)) of trees after 7 yr was greatest with white ash (434 cm(3)), followed by yellow poplar (256 cm(3)) and black walnut (138 cm(3)), then by black cherry (31 cm(3)) and red oak (27 cm(3)). Browsing by wildlife had a negative impact on tree growth especially on south aspect sites. Overall, mowing reduced survival of black cherry, red oak, and yellow poplar, but not for black walnut and white ash. Ripping increased survival of black cherry, red oak, and yellow poplar. Growth of all species was improved with ripping. Using inverse linear-quadratic plateau models, the time required for tree survival to stabilize varied from 1 yr for white ash to 6 to 9 yr for the other species.},

abstract = {Wetlands are sources of denitrification-derived nitrous oxide (N2O). Thus, the denitrifier community of an N2O-emitting fen (pH 4.7 to 5.2) was investigated. N2O was produced and consumed to subatmospheric concentrations in unsupplemented anoxic soil microcosms. Total cell counts and most probable numbers of denitrifiers approximated 10(11) cells x g(DW)(-1) (where DW is dry weight) and 10(8) cells x g(DW)(-1), respectively, in both 0- to 10-cm and 30- to 40-cm depths. Despite this uniformity, depth-related maximum reaction rate (v(max)) values for denitrification in anoxic microcosms ranged from 1 to 24 and -19 to -105 nmol N2O h(-1) x g(DW)(-1), with maximal values occurring in the upper soil layers. Denitrification was enhanced by substrates that might be formed via fermentation in anoxic microzones of soil. N2O approximated 40{\%} of total nitrogenous gases produced at in situ pH, which was likewise the optimal pH for denitrification. Gene libraries of narG and nosZ (encoding nitrate reductase and nitrous oxide reductase, respectively) from fen soil DNA yielded 15 and 18 species-level operational taxonomic units, respectively, many of which displayed phylogenetic novelty and were not closely related to cultured organisms. Although statistical analyses of narG and nosZ sequences indicated that the upper 20 cm of soil contained the highest denitrifier diversity and species richness, terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analyses of narG and nosZ revealed only minor differences in denitrifier community composition from a soil depth of 0 to 40 cm. The collective data indicate that the regional fen harbors novel, highly diverse, acid-tolerant denitrifier communities capable of complete denitrification and consumption of atmospheric N2O at in situ pH.},

abstract = {Soils harbor enormously diverse bacterial populations, and soil bacterial communities can vary greatly in composition across space. However, our understanding of the specific changes in soil bacterial community structure that occur across larger spatial scales is limited because most previous work has focused on either surveying a relatively small number of soils in detail or analyzing a larger number of soils with techniques that provide little detail about the phylogenetic structure of the bacterial communities. Here we used a bar-coded pyrosequencing technique to characterize bacterial communities in 88 soils from across North and South America, obtaining an average of 1,501 sequences per soil. We found that overall bacterial community composition, as measured by pairwise UniFrac distances, was significantly correlated with differences in soil pH (r = 0.79), largely driven by changes in the relative abundances of Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes across the range of soil pHs. In addition, soil pH explains a significant portion of the variability associated with observed changes in the phylogenetic structure within each dominant lineage. The overall phylogenetic diversity of the bacterial communities was also correlated with soil pH (R(2) = 0.50), with peak diversity in soils with near-neutral pHs. Together, these results suggest that the structure of soil bacterial communities is predictable, to some degree, across larger spatial scales, and the effect of soil pH on bacterial community composition is evident at even relatively coarse levels of taxonomic resolution.},

abstract = {We analyzed {\textgreater}10,000 topographic slope histograms subsampled from digital elevation models (DEMs) of 28 landscapes throughout the continental United States. These landscapes are made up of diverse lithologies and have different climatic and tectonic histories, but their slope distributions are consistently unimodal and collectively exhibit a systematic change from positively skewed to negatively skewed as mean slope increases. This change not only occurs between landscapes, but can also occur within them, and is recorded in DEMs of different spatial resolution. The transition from positive to negative skewness cannot be accounted for by scaling of relief, but requires a fundamental change in landscape morphology. Process-based landscape modeling reproduces the trend and suggests that a change in the dominant hillslope process-from creep and/or wash to slope failure-is responsible for the transition from positive to negative skewness with increasing mean slope. This process transition is governed by a dimensionless uplift number that reflects the balance between processes of relief generation and denudation. The uplift number provides a basis for understanding the morphologic similarity between landscapes in our analysis, illustrating how different combinations of climate, tectonics, and lithology can lead to equivalent morphologies.},

abstract = {Within the field of natural-resources management, the application of adaptive management is appropriate for complex problems high in uncertainty. Adaptive management is becoming an increasingly popular management-decision tool within the scientific community and has developed into two primary schools of thought: the Resilience-Experimentalist School (with high emphasis on stakeholder involvement, resilience, and highly complex models) and the Decision-Theoretic School (which results in relatively simple models through emphasizing stakeholder involvement for identifying management objectives). Because of these differences, adaptive management plans implemented under each of these schools may yield varying levels of success. We evaluated peer-reviewed literature focused on incorporation of adaptive management to identify components of successful adaptive management plans. Our evaluation included adaptive management elements such as stakeholder involvement, definitions of management objectives and actions, use and complexity of predictive models, and the sequence in which these elements were applied. We also defined a scale of degrees of success to make comparisons between the two adaptive management schools of thought. Our results include the relationship between the adaptive management process documented in the reviewed literature and our defined continuum of successful outcomes. Our data suggest an increase in the number of published articles with substantive discussion of adaptive management from 2000 to 2009 at a mean rate of annual change of 0.92 (r² = 0.56). Additionally, our examination of data for temporal patterns related to each school resulted in an increase in acknowledgement of the Decision-Theoretic School of thought at a mean annual rate of change of 0.02 (r² = 0.6679) and a stable acknowledgement for the Resilience-Experimentalist School of thought (r² = 0.0042; slope = 0.0013). Identifying the elements of successful adaptive management will be advantageous to natural-resources managers considering adaptive management as a decision tool.},

A number of effective decision making methods that support decisions under conditions of multiple criteria have appeared in the last decade. This paper presents a panorama of decision making methods in economics and summarizes the most important results and applications over the last five years.

@article{Tscharntke2005,
abstract = {Understanding the negative and positive effects of agricultural land use for the conservation of biodiversity, and its relation to ecosystem services, needs a landscape perspective. Agriculture can contribute to the conservation of high-diversity systems, which may provide important ecosystem services such as pollination and biological control via complementarity and sampling effects. Land-use management is often focused on few species and local processes, but in dynamic, agricultural landscapes, only a diversity of insurance species may guarantee resilience (the capacity to reorganize after disturbance). Interacting species experience their surrounding landscape at different spatial scales, which influences trophic interactions. Structurally complex landscapes enhance local diversity in agroecosystems, which may compensate for local high-intensity management. Organisms with high-dispersal abilities appear to drive these biodiversity patterns and ecosystem services, because of their recolonization ability and larger resources experienced. Agri-environment schemes (incentives for farmers to benefit the environment) need to broaden their perspective and to take the different responses to schemes in simple (high impact) and complex (low impact) agricultural landscapes into account. In simple landscapes, local allocation of habitat is more important than in complex landscapes, which are in total at risk. However, little knowledge of the relative importance of local and landscape management for biodiversity and its relation to ecosystem services make reliable recommendations difficult.},

We narrate the history of mitigation since the inception of the Clean Water Act Section 404 permit program in 1972, through struggles between the US Environmental Protection Agency and the US Army Corps of Engineers, through the emerging importance of wetland conservation on the American political landscape, and through the rise of market-based approaches to environmental policy. Mitigation, as it is understood today, was not initially foreseen as a component of the Section 404 permitting program, but was adapted from 1978 regulations issued by the Council on Environmental Quality as a way of replacing the functions of filled wetlands where permit denials were unlikely. EPA and the Corps agreed in 1990 to define mitigation as the three steps of avoidance, minimization, and compensation, principles which must be applied to permit decisions in the form of the environmental criteria in EPA's 404(b)(1) Guidelines. Through the 1980s and 1990s, the compensation component of mitigation has become nearly the sole focus of mitigation policy development, and has been the subject of numerous guidance documents and memoranda since 1990. Avoidance and minimization have received far less policy attention, and this lack of policy development may represent a missed opportunity to implement effective wetland conservation.},

abstract = {The intra- and inter-site spatial variability of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes were investigated in three alpine ecosystems at Haibei station on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) in summer 2005 and in sixteen alpine ecosystems with various vegetations across the QTP in summer 2006, respectively. The magnitude of average CH4 emissions from wetlands was at least 100 times larger than average CH4 uptake by grassland, suggesting that the entire QTP is likely to be a source of methane in summertime because of a significant fractional area of wetlands ({\~{}} 2.2{\%}) on the plateau.Intra-site investigation, with sixteen chambers, revealed a significant negative relationship of CH4 emissions with the C/N ratio of aboveground biomass and soil pH in the alpine wetland when all chambers were considered. Moreover, soil oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) had a remarkably strong influence on CH4 emissions for nine chambers above the water level, resulting in a negative exponential relationship. For N2O flux in alpine meadows, a negative relationship with both soil pH and livestock dung biomass was observed. Aboveground plant biomass and soil pH were important variables overall in wetlands.Inter-site investigation found positive and negative relationships between CH4 flux and soil biomass to 5 cm depth in nine grassland and seven wetland sites, respectively. N2O flux showed a moderately strong negative exponential relationship with the C/N ratio of surface soil in the grassland sites. In the wetlands, soil pH was negatively correlated with N2O flux, perhaps due to both reduced N2O release from suppressed nitrification and denitrification. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Active adaptive management balances the requirements of management with the need to learn about the system being managed, which leads to better decisions. It is difficult to judge the benefit of management actions that accelerate information gain, relative to the benefit of making the best management decision given what is known at the time. We present a first step in developing methods to optimize management decisions that incorporate both uncertainty and learning via adaptive management. We assumed a manager can allocate effort to discrete units (e.g., areas for revegetation or animals for reintroduction), the outcome can be measured as success or failure (e.g., the revegetation in an area is successful or the animal survives and breeds), and the manager has two possible management options from which to choose. We further assumed that there is an annual budget that may be allocated to one or both of the two options and that the manager must decide on the allocation. We used Bayesian updating of the probability of success of the two options and stochastic dynamic programming to determine the optimal strategy over a specified number of years. The costs, level of certainty about the success of the two options, and the timeframe of management all influenced the optimal allocation of the annual budget. In addition, the choice of management objective had a large influence on the optimal decision. In a case study of Merri Creek, Melbourne, Australia, we applied the approach to determining revegetation strategies. Our approach can be used to determine how best to manage ecological systems in the face of uncertainty.},

abstract = {Novel fire mitigation treatments that chip harvested biomass on site are increasingly prescribed to reduce the density of small-diameter trees, yet the ecological effects of these treatments are unknown. Our objective was to investigate the impacts of mechanical thinning and whole tree chipping on Pinus ponderosa (ponderosa pine) regeneration and understory plant communities to guide applications of these new fuel disposal methods. We sampled in three treatments: (1) unthinned forests (control), (2) thinned forests with harvested biomass removed (thin-only), and (3) thinned forests with harvested biomass chipped and broadcast on site (thin + chip). Plots were located in a ponderosa pine forest of Colorado and vegetation was sampled three to five growing seasons following treatment. Forest litter depth, augmented with chipped biomass, had a negative relationship with cover of understory plant species. In situ chipping often produces a mosaic of chipped patches tens of meters in size, creating a range of woodchip depths including areas lacking woodchip cover within thinned and chipped forest stands. Thin-only and thin + chip treatments had similar overall abundance and species richness of understory plants at the stand scale, but at smaller spatial scales, areas within thin + chip treatments that were free of woodchip cover had an increased abundance of understory vegetation compared to all other areas sampled. Relative cover of non-native plant species was significantly higher in the thin-only treatments compared to control and thin + chip areas. Thin + chip treated forests also had a significantly different understory plant community composition compared to control or thin-only treatments, including an increased richness of rhizomatous plant species. We suggest that thinning followed by either chipping or removing the harvested biomass could alter understory plant species composition in ponderosa pine forests of Colorado. When considering post-treatment responses, managers should be particularly aware of both the depth and the distribution of chipped biomass that is left in forested landscapes. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {‘‘Sustainability'' has become the word of the day and the theme of our time. The word—which in essence means meeting the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future genera- tions to meet their own (WCED 1987)—tends to conjure bucolic images of landscapes with green hills and empty spaces, but that may be a mistake. Our world certainly is replete with environmental prob- lems: biodiversity loss, ecosystem degradation, land- scape fragmentation, climate change, just to name a few. Urbanization—the spatial expansion of the built environment that is densely packed by people and their socioeconomic activities—has often been held responsible for all these problems. In the recent serge of interest in sustainability, some think that urbani- zation is key to regional and global sustainability, whereas others regard urban sustainability as an oxymoron. Is urbanization a problem or part of the solution for sustainability? Why is it relevant to landscape ecology?},

abstract = {The influence of inland water bodies on the global carbon cycle and the great potential for long-term carbon burial in them is an important component of global limnology. We used paleolimnological methods to estimate changes in carbon burial rates through time in a suite of natural lakes in the US state of Iowa which has watersheds that have been heavily modified over the last 150 years. Our results show increasing carbon burial for all lakes in our study as agriculture intensified. Our estimates of carbon burial rates, before land clearance, are similar to the published worldwide averages for nutrient-poor lakes. In nearly all the cases, burial rates increased to very high levels (up to 200 g C m −2 y −1 ) following agricultural development. These results support the idea that the increased autochthonous and allochthonous carbon flux, related to anthropogenic change, leads to higher rates of carbon burial. Further, these results imply that the fraction of global carbon buried by lakes will be increasingly important in the future if worldwide trends in anthropogenic eutrophication continue.},

abstract = {WorldView commercial imaging satellites comprise a constellation developed by DigitalGlobe Inc. (Longmont, CO, USA). Worldview-3 (WV-3), currently planned for launch in 2014, will have 8 spectral bands in the Visible and Near-Infrared (VNIR), and an additional 8 bands in the Short-Wave-Infrared (SWIR); the approximately 1.0–2.5 $\mu$m spectral range. WV-3 will be the first commercial system with both high spatial resolution and multispectral SWIR capability. Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) data collected at 3 m spatial resolution with 86 SWIR bands having 10 nm spectral resolution were used to simulate the new WV-3 SWIR data. AVIRIS data were converted to reflectance, geographically registered, and resized to the proposed 3.7 and 7.5 m spatial resolutions. WV-3 SWIR band pass functions were used to spectrally resample the data to the proposed 8 SWIR bands. Characteristic reflectance signatures extracted from the data for known mineral locations (endmembers) were used to map spatial locations of specific minerals. The WV-3 results, when compared to spectral mapping using the full AVIRIS SWIR dataset, illustrate that the WV-3 spectral bands should permit identification and mapping of some key minerals, however, minerals with similar spectral features may be confused and will not be mapped with the same detail as using hyperspectral systems. The high spatial resolution should provide detailed mapping of complex alteration mineral patterns not achievable by current multispectral systems. The WV-3 simulation results are promising and indicate that this sensor will be a significant tool for geologic remote sensing.},

N03- uptake lengths var- ied two orders of magnitude (24-4247 m), with uptake rates (6.5-158.1 mg N03 -N m-2 day- 1 ) and uptake velocities (0.1-2.3 mm min-1) falling within the ranges measured in other LINX II re- gions. Denitrification removed 0-7{\%} of added tra- cer from our streams. In forest streams, 60.4 to 77.0{\%} of the isotope tracer was exported down- stream as N03 -,with 8.0 to 14.8{\%} stored in wood biofilms, epilithon, fine benthic organic matter, and bryophytes. Agricultural and urban streams with streamside forest buffers displayed hydrologic ex- port and organic matter storage of tracer similar to those measured in forest streams. In agricultural and urban streams with a partial or no riparian buffer, less than 1 to 75{\%} of the tracer was ex- ported downstream; much of the remainder was taken up and stored in autotrophic organic matter components with short N turnover times. Our findings suggest restoration and maintenance of riparian forests can help re-establish the natural range of N03- uptake processes in human-altered streams. Key},

Using examples from southwest Ohio, we show that recent$\backslash$nchannel instability is largely a consequence of reduced sediment supply$\backslash$nover several past decades. The widths of the studied channels narrowed$\backslash$nby a factor of three to four between the 1930s and 2000s, and channel$\backslash$nbeds have incised into glacial sediments. Lateral migration of these$\backslash$nchannels decreased after 1960, signaling the onset of channel incision.$\backslash$nSoil loss rates in 2005 were 4 to 20 times lower than in the 1920s,$\backslash$nmainly as a result of the shift from conventional to conservation$\backslash$ntillage. The construction of impoundments has further reduced sediment$\backslash$ndelivery downstream, and climate change may exacerbate this imbalance by$\backslash$nincreasing sediment transport capacity including peak flows. Thus the$\backslash$ndecrease in sediment supply occurred during a time when peak stream$\backslash$nflows have been increasing, resulting in an imbalance between sediment$\backslash$nsupply and sediment transporting power in the stream systems.

abstract = {Pollution from abandoned mines is a serious, widespread and increasingly common cause of surface water degradation in the LOIS study region. Indeed, in some areas of the UK it is now the single greatest cause of freshwater pollution. Remediation of such pollution in the long-term is probably best achieved by passive treatment, which has the advantage of concentrating expenditure in capital costs, with only modest financial commitments for long-term maintenance. To plan such remediation, however, it is important to have an understanding of the physical and chemical processes governing pollutant release over scales of many decades. By analysing water quality records for major abandoned mine discharges in Scotland, Wales and Cornwall, long-term acidity generation is shown to have two components: 'vestigial' and 'juvenile'. The vestigial component relates to the geochemical trauma which occurs as abandoned mine voids are allowed to fill with water for the first time, taking ferrous and ferric hydroxysulphate salts (intermediate products of pyrite oxidation) into solution. Dissipation of vestigial acidity is primarily controlled by the hydraulic retention time of the flooded mine system, and will generally be accomplished in less than 40 years. Juvenile acidity arises from on-going pyrite oxidation in the zone of water table fluctuation within the mined system, and can be expected to continue for many hundreds of years, until the supply of pyrite is finally exhausted. Rational planning for the remediation of minewater pollution should be based on intensive treatment of discharges while the vestigial acidity is being depleted, followed by long-term passive treatment of the juvenile acidity.},

abstract = {In ancient orogens, such as the Appalachian Mountains in the eastern United States, the difference between the high and low points-topographic relief-can continue to increase long after the tectonic forces that created the range have becomeinactive. Climatic forcing(1) and mantle-induced dynamic uplift(2,3) could drive formation of relief, but clear evidence is lacking in the Appalachian Mountains. Here I use a numerical simulation of dynamic topography in North America, combined with reconstructions of the sedimentation history from the Gulf of Mexico(4), to show that rejuvenation of topographic relief in the Appalachian Mountains since the Palaeogene period could have been caused by mantle-induced dynamic subsidence associated with sinking of the subducted Farallon slab. Specifically, I show that patterns of continental erosion and the eastward migration of sediment deposition centres in the Gulf ofMexico closely followthe locus of predicted dynamic subsidence. Furthermore, pulses of rapid sediment deposition in the Gulf of Mexico(4) and western Atlantic(5) correlate with enhanced erosion in the Appalachian Mountains during the Miocene epoch, caused by dynamic tilting of the continent. The model predicts that such subsidence-induced differential erosion caused flexural-isostatic adjustments of Appalachian topography that led to the development of 400 m of relief and more than 200m of elevation. I propose that dynamically induced continental tilting may provide a mechanism for topographic rejuvenation in ancient orogens.},

abstract = {Mechanical mastication is increasingly prescribed for wildfire mitigation, yet little is known about the ecological impacts of this fuels treatment. Mastication shreds trees into woodchips as an alternative to tree thinning and burning the resulting slash, which can create soil disturbances that favor exotic plants. Previous research on mastication has not simultaneously considered both the responses of soil organisms and understory plant communities. We compared mastication to slash pile burning (both 6-months and 2.5-years post-treatment) and untreated controls in pinyon-juniper (Pinus edulis-Juniperus osteosperma) woodland and measured soil properties, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and understory plant composition. Our results showed that slash pile burns had severely degraded soil properties and low AMF abundance and richness compared to untreated or mastication plots. Pile burns were dominated by exotic plant species and had approximately 6× less understory plant abundance and richness than untreated plots. Only two variables differed between mastication and untreated plots 6-months post-treatment: mastication had lower soil temperature and higher soil moisture. Mastication plots 2.5-years post-treatment had more plant cover and richness than untreated plots or pile burns, although non-native Bromus tectorum cover was also greater and AMF spore richness was lower than untreated plots. The structural equation model (SEM) we developed showed that plant cover strongly influenced AMF abundance (0.50) and both plant cover (0.36) and AMF (0.31) positively influenced soil stability. In the short-term, mastication is a preferable method as it creates fewer disturbances than pile burning; however long-term impacts of mastication need further study as this practice could affect native plant communities. Our results suggest that the manner in which woody debris is treated following tree thinning has an important influence on soil stability and native plant biodiversity. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

Under the emerging biogeochemical configurations, management activities are experiments, blurring the line between basic and applied research. Responses to specific management manipulations are context specific, influenced by the current status or structure of the system, and this necessitates reference areas for management or restoration activities. Attempts to return systems to within their historical range of biotic and abiotic characteristics and processes may not be possible, and management activities directed at removing undesirable features of novel ecosystems may perpetuate or create such ecosystems. Management actions should attempt to maintain genetic and species diversity and encourage the biogeochemical characteristics that favor desirable species. Few resources currently exist to support the addition of proactive measures and rigorous experimental designs to current management activities. The necessary changes will not occur without strong input from stakeholders and policy makers, so rapid information transfer and proactive research–management activities by the scientific community are needed.},

About half the global wetland area has been lost, but an international treaty (the 1971 Ramsar Convention) has helped 144 nations protect the most significant remaining wetlands. Because most nations lack wetland inventories, changes in the quantity and quality of the world's wetlands cannot be tracked adequately. Despite the likelihood that remaining wetlands occupy less than 9{\%} of the earth's land area, they contribute more to annually renewable ecosystem services than their small area implies. Biodiversity support, water quality improvement, flood abatement, and carbon sequestration are key functions that are impaired when wetlands are lost or degraded. Restoration techniques are improving, although the recovery of lost biodiversity is challenged by invasive species, which thrive under disturbance and displace natives. Not all damages to wetlands are reversible, but it is not always clear how much can be retained through restoration. Hence, we recommend adaptive approaches in which alternative techniques are tested at large scales in actual restoration sites.},

abstract = {A numerical model describing the coupled evolution of the biogeochemical cycles of carbon, sulfur, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, and strontium has been developed to describe the long-term changes of atmospheric carbon dioxide and climate during the Phanerozoic.  The emphasis is on the effects of coupling the cycles of carbon and strontium.  Various interpretations of the observed Phanerozoic history of the seawater 87Sr/86Sr ratio are investigated with the model.  More specifically, the abilities of continental weathering, volcanism, and surface lithology in generating that signal are tested and compared.  It is suggested that the observed fluctuations are mostly due to a changing weatherability over time.  It is shown that such a conclusion is very important for the modelling of the carbon cycle.  Indeed, it implies that the conventional belief that the evolution of atmospheric carbon dioxide and climate on a long time scale is governed by the balance between the volcanic input of CO2 and the rate of silicate weathering is not true.  Rather carbon exchanges between the mantle and the exogenic system are likely to have played a key role too.  Further, the increase of the global weathering rates with increasing surface temperature and/or atmospheric CO2 pressure usually postulated in long-term carbon cycle and climate modelling is also inconsistent with the new model.  Other factors appear to have modulated the weatherability of the continents through time, such as mountain building and the existence of glaciers and ice sheets.  Based on these observations, a history of atmospheric carbon dioxide and climate during Phanerozoic time, consistent with the strontium isotopic data, is reconstructed with the model and is shown to be compatible with paleoclimatic indicators, such as the timing of glaciation and the estimates of Cretaceous paleotemperatures.},

abstract = {Inland water ecosystems dynamically process, transport, and sequester carbon. However, the transport of carbon through aquatic environments has not been quantitatively integrated in the context of terrestrial ecosystems. Here, we present the first integrated assessment, to our knowledge, of freshwater carbon fluxes for the conterminous United States, where 106 (range: 71–149) teragrams of carbon per year (TgC⋅y−1) is exported downstream or emitted to the atmosphere and sedimentation stores 21 (range: 9–65) TgC⋅y−1 in lakes and reservoirs. We show that there is significant regional variation in aquatic carbon flux, but verify that emission across stream and river surfaces represents the dominant flux at 69 (range: 36–110) TgC⋅y−1 or 65{\%} of the total aquatic carbon flux for the conterminous United States. Comparing our results with the output of a suite of terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs), we suggest that within the current modeling framework, calculations of net ecosystem production (NEP) defined as terrestrial only may be overestimated by as much as 27{\%}. However, the internal production and mineralization of carbon in freshwaters remain to be quantified and would reduce the effect of including aquatic carbon fluxes within calculations of terrestrial NEP. Reconciliation of carbon mass–flux interactions between terrestrial and aquatic carbon sources and sinks will require significant additional research and modeling capacity.},

abstract = {In recent years, due to public concern over perceived and actual environmental impacts, the global mining industry has been moving towards a more sustainable framework. For gold mining, there are a number of fundamental issues with regard to assessing sustainability. Commonly perceived as a finite and non-renewable resource, long-term gold production trends include declining ore grades and increasing solid wastes (tailings, waste rock) and open cut mining. Conversely, core sustainability issues include water, energy and chemical consumption and pollutant emissions-also known as 'resource intensity'. It is important to recognise the links between gold production trends and resource intensity, as this is critical for understanding future sustainability challenges. This paper links data sets on historic gold mining production trends with emerging sustainability reporting to estimate resource intensity, demonstrating the sensitivity of ore grade for gold production and sustainability. Final judgement of the sustainability of gold mining must take account of the sensitivity of the ore grade in the resource intensity of gold production. This has implications for environmental policy and sustainability reporting in the gold mining sector. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Pedology was born in the 18th and 19th centuries, when soil was first conceived as a natural body worthy of its own scientific investigation. For well over a century, pedology explored soil as a system developed froma complex of natural processes. By themid-20th century, however, human activities began to affect substantial global soil changes with influence on the dynamics of the Earth's environment. Such anthropedo- genesis was first defined as Bmetapedogenesis[ by Yaalon and Yaron (1966), a definition that we propose here to be as important to the development of pedology as the natural-body concept of soil first articulated by Dokuchaev and Hilgard more than a century ago. In this article, we distinguish between humanity's contemporary and historic influences on soil, as it is increasingly important for ecosystem analysis and management to distinguish contemporary changes that are overlain on those from the past. Although our understanding of global soil change is strikingly elementary, it is fundamental to establishing greater management control over Earth's rapidly changing ecosystems. Humanity's transformation of Earth's soil challenges scientists to develop a pedology with broad purview and decades' time scale, a pedology that supports the science andmanagement of the environment, ecosystems, and global change.},

abstract = {Analyses of fossil seeds and pollen grains preserved in seven sediment cores and borings were combined with historical land-use records to reconstruct an 1800-yr history of Otter Point Creek (OPC), a freshwater tidal deltaic wetland in the upper Chesapeake Bay. The objectives of the study were to document the role of natural and anthropogenic disturbance on habitat development at different sites within the wetland. Fossil seeds revealed a 1500-yr period (AD 230 to 1700) of subtidal habitat stability characterized by the aquatic macrophytes Zannichellia palustris, Najas gracillima, N guadalupensis, Elodea canadensis and Vallisneria americana. Natural disturbance had little or no impact on the estuarine habitat during this time. By the early 1700s, forest clearance for agriculture and lumber during European settlement led to higher erosion rates in the watershed. This led to rapid sediment efflux and broad habitat changes along a hydrologic gradient within the estuary. The aquatic macrophytes disappeared when estuarine sedimentation rates increased from a pre-1700 mean of 0.05 cm/yr to 0.60 cm/yr after 1730-1750. As the estuary continued to fill behind a prograding delta from AD 1750 to 1950, sub-tidal species were replaced sequentially by increasingly less flood-tolerant dominants of low marsh (Zizania aquatica), middle marsh (Typha angustifolia or Leersia oryzoides), high marsh (Acorus calamus), shrub marsh (Typha latifolia and Salix nigra) and riparian forest (Acer negundo, Fraxinus pennsylvanica and Betula nigra). Habitat change progressed in pulses followed by periods of habitat stasis. The most rapid and extensive period of change occurred between 1840 and 1880, synchronous with the period of highest sedimentation rates, mid- century storms and intensive land use in the watershed. The rate and pattern of community change differed among sites where position relative to the watershed, local disturbance, and channel shifts at or adjacent to the site influenced different community pathways. A conceptual model is proposed to describe the spatial and temporal development of eastern US freshwater tidal wetland habitats, reflecting the importance of the impact of colonial deforestation.},

Here, we assert the congruence of Tansley's (1935) venerable ecosystem concept of ‘one physical system' with Earth science's critical zone. Ecosystems and critical zones are congruent across spatial–temporal scales from vegetation-clad weathering profiles and hillslopes, small catchments, landscapes, river basins, continents, to Earth's whole terrestrial surface. What may be less obvious is congruence in the vertical dimension. We use ecosystem metabolism to argue that full accounting of photosynthetically fixed carbon includes respiratory CO2 and carbonic acid that propagate to the base of the critical zone itself. Although a small fraction of respiration, the downward diffusion of CO2 helps determine rates of soil formation and, ultimately, ecosystem evolution and resilience. Because life in the upper portions of terrestrial ecosystems significantly affects biogeochemistry throughout weathering profiles, the lower boundaries of most terrestrial ecosystems have been demarcated at depths too shallow to permit a complete understanding of ecosystem structure and function. Opportunities abound to explore connections between upper and lower components of critical-zone ecosystems, between soils and streams in watersheds, and between plant-derived CO2 and deep microbial communities and mineral weathering.},

abstract = {Looking back to move forward The current impacts of humanity on nature are rapid and destructive, but species turnover and change have occurred throughout the history of life. Although there is much debate about the best approaches to take in conservation, ultimately, we need to permit or enhance the resilience of natural systems so that they can continue to adapt and function into the future. In a Review, Barnosky et al. argue that the best way to do this is to look back at paleontological history as a way to understand how ecological resilience is maintained, even in the face of change. Science, this issue p. eaah4787 Structured Abstract BACKGROUNDThe pace and magnitude of human-caused global change has accelerated dramatically over the past 50 years, overwhelming the capacity of many ecosystems and species to maintain themselves as they have under the more stable conditions that prevailed for at least 11,000 years. The next few decades threaten even more rapid transformations because by 2050, the human population is projected to grow by 3 billion while simultaneously increasing per capita consumption. Thus, to avoid losing many species and the crucial aspects of ecosystems that we need—for both our physical and emotional well-being—new conservation paradigms and integration of information from conservation biology, paleobiology, and the Earth sciences are required. ADVANCESRather than attempting to hold ecosystems to an idealized conception of the past, as has been the prevailing conservation paradigm until recently, maintaining vibrant ecosystems for the future now requires new approaches that use both historical and novel conservation landscapes, enhance adaptive capacity for ecosystems and organisms, facilitate connectedness, and manage ecosystems for functional integrity rather than focusing entirely on particular species. Scientific breakthroughs needed to underpin such a paradigm shift are emerging at the intersection of ecology and paleobiology, revealing (i) which species and ecosystems will need human intervention to persist; (ii) how to foster population connectivity that anticipates rapidly changing climate and land use; (iii) functional attributes that characterize ecosystems through thousands to millions of years, irrespective of the species that are involved; and (iv) the range of compositional and functional variation that ecosystems have exhibited over their long histories. Such information is necessary for recognizing which current changes foretell transitions to less robust ecological states and which changes may signal benign ecosystem shifts that will cause no substantial loss of ecosystem function or services.Conservation success will also increasingly hinge on choosing among different, sometimes mutually exclusive approaches to best achieve three conceptually distinct goals: maximizing biodiversity, maximizing ecosystem services, and preserving wilderness. These goals vary in applicability depending on whether historical or novel ecosystems are the conservation target. Tradeoffs already occur—for example, managing to maximize certain ecosystem services upon which people depend (such as food production on farm or rangelands) versus maintaining healthy populations of vulnerable species (such as wolves, lions, or elephants). In the future, the choices will be starker, likely involving decisions such as which species are candidates for managed relocation and to which areas, and whether certain areas should be off limits for intensive management, even if it means losing some species that now live there. Developing the capacity to make those choices will require conservation in both historical and novel ecosystems and effective collaboration of scientists, governmental officials, nongovernmental organizations, the legal community, and other stakeholders. OUTLOOKConservation efforts are currently in a state of transition, with active debate about the relative importance of preserving historical landscapes with minimal human impact on one end of the ideological spectrum versus manipulating novel ecosystems that result from human activities on the other. Although the two approaches are often presented as dichotomous, in fact they are connected by a continuum of practices, and both are needed. In most landscapes, maximizing conservation success will require more integration of paleobiology and conservation biology because in a rapidly changing world, a long-term perspective (encompassing at least millennia) is necessary to specify and select appropriate conservation targets and plans. Although adding this long-term perspective will be essential to sustain biodiversity and all of the facets of nature that humans need as we continue to rapidly change the world over the next few decades, maximizing the chances of success will also require dealing with the root causes of the conservation crisis: rapid growth of the human population, increasing per capita consumption especially in developed countries, and anthropogenic climate change that is rapidly pushing habitats outside the bounds experienced by today's species. {\{}{\textless}{\}}img class="fragment-image" src="https://d2ufo47lrtsv5s.cloudfront.net/content/sci/355/6325/eaah4787/F1.medium.gif"/{\{}{\textgreater}{\}} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fewer than 900 mountain gorillas are left in the world, and their continued existence depends upon the choices humans make, exemplifying the state of many species and ecosystems.Can conservation biology save biodiversity and all the aspects of nature that people need and value as 3 billion more of us are added to the planet by 2050, while climate continues to change to states outside the bounds that most of today's ecosystems have ever experienced?Photo: E. A. Hadly, at Volcanoes National Park, Rwanda Conservation of species and ecosystems is increasingly difficult because anthropogenic impacts are pervasive and accelerating. Under this rapid global change, maximizing conservation success requires a paradigm shift from maintaining ecosystems in idealized past states toward facilitating their adaptive and functional capacities, even as species ebb and flow individually. Developing effective strategies under this new paradigm will require deeper understanding of the long-term dynamics that govern ecosystem persistence and reconciliation of conflicts among approaches to conserving historical versus novel ecosystems. Integrating emerging information from conservation biology, paleobiology, and the Earth sciences is an important step forward on the path to success. Maintaining nature in all its aspects will also entail immediately addressing the overarching threats of growing human population, overconsumption, pollution, and climate change.},

abstract = {In recent years, the use of airborne lidar technology to measure forest biophysical characteristics has been rapidly increasing. This paper discusses processing algorithms for deriving the terrain model and estimating tree heights by using a multiple return, high-density, small-footprint lidar data set. The lidar data were acquired over deciduous, coniferous, and mixed stands of varying age classes and settings typical of the southeastern US. The specific objectives were: (1) to develop and test algorithms to estimate plot level tree height using lidar data, and (2) to investigate how ground measurements can help in the processing phase of lidar data for tree height assessment. The study area is located in the Piedmont physiographic province of Virginia, USA and includes a portion of the Appomattox-Buckingham State Forest (37??25???N, 78??41???W). Two lidar processing algorithms are discussed - the first based on single tree crown identification using a variable window size for local filtering, and the second based on the height of all laser pulses within the area covered by the ground truth data. Height estimates resulted from processing lidar data with both algorithms were compared to field measurements obtained with a plot design following the USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) field data layout. Linear regression was used to develop equations relating lidar-estimated parameters with field inventories for each of the FIA plots. As expected, the maximum height on each plot was predicted with the highest accuracy (R2 values of 85 and 90{\%}, for the first and the second algorithm, respectively). The variable window size algorithm performed better for predicting heights of dominant and co-dominant trees (R2 values 84-85{\%}), with a diameter at breast height (dbh) larger than 12.7 cm (5 in), when compared with the algorithm based on all laser heights (R2 values 57-73{\%}). The use of field-based height thresholds when processing lidar data did not bring significant gains in explaining the total variation associated with tree height. The technique of local filtering with a variable window size considers fundamental forest biometrics relationships and overall proved to give better results than the technique of all laser shots. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Mountaintop removal/valley fill (MTR/VF) mining in the central Appalachians is a major driver of landscape change within terrestrial ecosystems. We quantified avian community and individual taxa thresholds in response to changing landscapes from MTR/VF using a Threshold Indicator Taxa Analysis approach. We conducted 50-m fixed radius avian surveys (n = 707) within forest adjacent to mine lands in 2012-2013 and obtained data for additional surveys (n = 905) sampled using comparable methods during 2008-2013. We quantified positive and negative community, habitat guild, and species thresholds in abundance and occurrence for each of five landscape metrics within a 1-km radius of each survey point. Reclaimed mine-dominated landscapes (less forest and more grassland/shrubland cover) elicited more negative (57 {\%}) than positive (39 {\%}) species responses. Negative thresholds for each landscape metric generally occurred at lower values than positive thresholds, thus negatively responding species were detrimentally affected before positively responding species benefitted. Forest interior birds generally responded negatively to landscape metric thresholds, interior edge species responses were mixed, and early successional birds responded positively. The forest interior guild declined most at 4 {\%} forest loss, while the shrubland guild increased greatest after 52 {\%} loss. Based on random forest importance ranks, total amount of landscape grassland/shrubland had the most influence, although this varied by guild. Because of little overlap in habitat requirements, managing landscapes simultaneously to maximally benefit both guilds may not be possible. Our avian thresholds identify single community management targets accounting for scarce species. Guild or individual species thresholds allow for species-specific management.},

abstract = {Understanding the population dynamics of native and nonnative fishes is critical for guiding and evaluating management activities, but obtaining information on population dynamics is often dependent on identifying structures that provide precise estimates of age. We examined age estimation using various hard structures for native bluehead suckers Catostomus discobolus, flannelmouth suckers C. latipinnis, and roundtail chub Gila robusta, and nonnative white suckers C. commersonii, creek chub Semotilus atromaculatus, white sucker × bluehead sucker hybrids, and white sucker × flannelmouth sucker hybrids in a small headwater stream of the upper Colorado River basin (UCRB) in Wyoming. We evaluated between-reader precision (i.e., between two readers) and agreement of otolith age estimates with estimates from scales, fin rays, cleithra, and opercular bones. Exact agreement between readers was highest for otoliths (66–96{\%} among species) and fin rays (61–92{\%}) and lowest for opercles (25–69{\%}), cleithra (21–41{\%}), and scales (15–48{\%}). Age estimates from fin rays were almost exactly the same as those from otoliths for all species except creek chub, for which fin ray estimates were consistently lower than otolith estimates. Age estimates from scales were generally 1–4 years lower than those from otoliths for most species, and most discrepancies occurred when otolith ages were greater than 5 years. We recommend that fin rays be used to estimate age of native catostomids and roundtail chub in the UCRB because fin rays provide accurate estimates of otolith age and can be obtained without sacrificing fish. We further recommend that otoliths be used to estimate age of creek chub in the UCRB because accuracy of fin rays was poor and because sacrificing this nonnative species may benefit native fishes of the UCRB.},

abstract = {An intertidal San Francisco Bay salt marsh was used to study the spatial relationships between vegetation patterns and hydrologic and edaphic variables. Multiple abiotic variables were represented by six metrics: elevation, distance to major tidal channels and to the nearest channel of any size, edaphic conditions during dry and wet circumstances, and the magnitude of tidally induced changes in soil saturation and salinity. A new approach, quantitative differential electromagnetic induction (Q-DEMI), was developed to obtain the last metric. The approach converts the difference in soil electrical conductivity (ECa) between dry and wet conditions to quantitative maps of tidally induced changes in root zone soil water content and salinity. The result is a spatially exhaustive map of edaphic changes throughout the mapped area of the ecosystem. Spatially distributed data on the six metrics were used to explore two hypotheses: (1) multiple abiotic variables relevant to vegetation zonation each exhibit different, uncorrelated, spatial patterns throughout an intertidal salt marsh; (2) vegetation zones and habitats of individual plant species are uniquely characterized by different combinations of key metrics. The first hypothesis was supported by observed, uncorrelated spatial variability in the metrics. The second hypothesis was supported by binary logistic regression models that identified key vegetation zone and species habitat characteristics from among the six metrics. Based on results from 108 models, the Q-DEMI map of saturation and salinity change was the most useful metric of those tested for distinguishing different vegetation zones and plant species habitats in the salt marsh.},

abstract = {Interactions among hydrology and geomorphology create shifting mosaics of aquatic habitat patches in large river floodplains (e.g.; main and side channels, floodplain lakes, and shallow backwater areas) and the connectivity among these habitat patches underpins high levels of biotic diversity and productivity. However, the diversity and connectivity among the habitats of most floodplain rivers have been negatively impacted by hydrologic and structural modifications that support commercial navigation and control flooding. We therefore tested the hypothesis that the rate of increase in patch richness ({\#} of types) with increasing scale reflects anthropogenic modifications to habitat diversity and connectivity in a large floodplain river, the Upper Mississippi River (UMR). To do this, we calculated the number of aquatic habitat patch types within neighborhoods surrounding each of the ≈19 million 5-m aquatic pixels of the UMR for multiple neighborhood sizes (1-100 ha). For all of the 87 river-reach focal areas we examined, changes in habitat richness (R) with increasing neighborhood length (L, {\#} pixels) were characterized by a fractal-like power function R = Lz (R2 {\textgreater} 0.92 (P {\textless} 0.05)). The scaling exponent (z) measures the rate of increase in habitat richness with neighborhood size and is related to a fractal dimension. Variation in z reflected fundamental changes to spatial patterns of aquatic habitat richness in this river system. With only a few exceptions, z exceeded the river-wide average of 0.18 in focal areas where side channels, contiguous floodplain lakes, and contiguous shallow-water areas exceeded 5{\%}, 5{\%}, and 10{\%} of the floodplain respectively. In contrast, z was always less than 0.18 for focal areas where impounded water exceeded 40{\%} of floodplain area. Our results suggest that rehabilitation efforts that target areas with {\textless}5{\%} of the floodplain in side channels, {\textless}5{\%} in floodplain lakes, and/or {\textless}10{\%} in shallow-water areas could improve habitat diversity across multiple scales in the UMR. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Nature is usually assumed to respond to gradual change in a smooth way. However, studies on lakes, coral reefs, oceans, forests and arid lands have shown that smooth change can be interrupted by sudden drastic switches to a contrasting state. Although diverse events can trigger such shifts, recent studies show that a loss of resilience usually paves the way for a switch to an alternative state. This suggests that strategies for sustainable management of such ecosystems should focus on maintaining resilience.},

Discovery of new classes of antibiotics has not kept pace; new agents often suffer from cross-resistance to existing agents of similar structure. Short, cationic peptides with antimicrobial activity are essential to the host defenses of many organisms and represent a promising new class of antimicrobials. This paper reports the successful in silico screening for potent antibiotic peptides using a combination of QSAR and machine learning techniques. On the basis of initial high-throughput measurements of activity of over 1400 random peptides, artificial neural network models were built using QSAR descriptors and subsequently used to screen an in silico library of approximately 100,000 peptides. In vitro validation of the modeling showed 94{\%} accuracy in identifying highly active peptides. The best peptides identified through screening were found to have activities comparable or superior to those of four conventional antibiotics and superior to the peptide most advanced in clinical development against a broad array of multiresistant human pathogens.},

abstract = {The present mountain pine beetle infestation in forests in British Columbia ranks among the largest ecological disturbances recorded in Canada so far. These recent outbreaks are thought to have been favoured by large-scale climatic shifts, and may foreshadow outbreaks of a similar magnitude in North American forests over the coming decades. The associated forest dieback could result in substantial shifts in evapotranspiration and albedo, thereby altering the local surface energy balance, and in turn regional temperature and climate. Here we quantify the impact of the Canadian pine beetle disturbance on the local summertime surface energy budget, using measurements of evapotranspiration, albedo and surface temperature, obtained primarily through remote sensing. We show that over the 170,000 km(2) of affected forest, the typical decrease in summertime evapotranspiration is 19{\%}. Changes to the absorbed short-wave flux are negligible, in comparison. As a result, outgoing sensible and radiative heat fluxes increased by 8{\%} and 1{\%}, respectively, corresponding to a typical increase in surface temperature of 1 degrees C. These changes are comparable to those observed for other types of disturbance, such as wildfire, and may have secondary consequences for climate, including modifications to circulation, cloud cover and precipitation.},

abstract = {Floodplain rivers have been conceptualized as patchwork mosaics of hydrogeomorphic zones that differ in hydrological, physiochemical, and ecological conditions. However, few investigators have empirically examined the extent to which basic ecological properties of large rivers, such as nutrient concentrations, are patchily distributed or the relationship between such distributions and water-mediated connectivity. We used global and local measures of spatial autocorrelation in 5 reaches of the Upper Mississippi River from 1994–2008 in spring (higher discharge) and summer (lower discharge) to examine distributions of total N (TN), total P (TP), and TN:TP for evidence of patchiness. TN was distributed as discrete patches regardless of season, but the patches of TP and TN:TP were more distinct during summer low-flow than spring high-flow conditions. The occurrence of patches of low TN, high TP, and low TN:TP was highly predictable, generally occurring in backwater, low-velocity (0.1 m/s) environments. Patches of high TN, low TP, and high TN:TP were less common and less predictable, but were more likely to occur in channels with high current velocities (.0.1 m/s) or in impounded areas with low current velocity, but adjacent to channel environments. These patch distributions are consistent with our current understanding of dominant mechanisms of riverine nutrient cycling and were generally consistent across 5 river reaches that spanned nearly the entire length of a large floodplain river. Watershed characteristics ultimately determine nutrient inputs to river systems, but our results support the idea that local geomorphic and hydraulic conditions influence spatial patterns of nutrient delivery and biochemical transformation and create a patchwork mosaic of nutrient distributions within large floodplain rivers},

abstract = {Atmospheric reactions and slow geological processes controlled Earth's earliest nitrogen cycle, and by {\~{}}2.7 billion years ago, a linked suite of microbial processes evolved to form the modern nitrogen cycle with robust natural feedbacks and controls. Over the past century, however, the development of new agricultural practices to satisfy a growing global demand for food has drastically disrupted the nitrogen cycle. This has led to extensive eutrophication of fresh waters and coastal zones as well as increased inventories of the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N(2)O). Microbial processes will ultimately restore balance to the nitrogen cycle, but the damage done by humans to the nitrogen economy of the planet will persist for decades, possibly centuries, if active intervention and careful management strategies are not initiated.},

@article{DeConto2012b,
abstract = {Between about 55.5 and 52 million years ago, Earth experienced a series of sudden and extreme global warming events (hyperthermals) superimposed on a long-term warming trend. The first and largest of these events, the Palaeocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), is characterized by a massive input of carbon, ocean acidification and an increase in global temperature of about 5 °C within a few thousand years. Although various explanations for the PETM have been proposed, a satisfactory model that accounts for the source, magnitude and timing of carbon release at the PETM and successive hyperthermals remains elusive. Here we use a new astronomically calibrated cyclostratigraphic record from central Italy to show that the Early Eocene hyperthermals occurred during orbits with a combination of high eccentricity and high obliquity. Corresponding climate-ecosystem-soil simulations accounting for rising concentrations of background greenhouse gases and orbital forcing show that the magnitude and timing of the PETM and subsequent hyperthermals can be explained by the orbitally triggered decomposition of soil organic carbon in circum-Arctic and Antarctic terrestrial permafrost. This massive carbon reservoir had the potential to repeatedly release thousands of petagrams (10(15) grams) of carbon to the atmosphere-ocean system, once a long-term warming threshold had been reached just before the PETM. Replenishment of permafrost soil carbon stocks following peak warming probably contributed to the rapid recovery from each event, while providing a sensitive carbon reservoir for the next hyperthermal. As background temperatures continued to rise following the PETM, the areal extent of permafrost steadily declined, resulting in an incrementally smaller available carbon pool and smaller hyperthermals at each successive orbital forcing maximum. A mechanism linking Earth's orbital properties with release of soil carbon from permafrost provides a unifying model accounting for the salient features of the hyperthermals.},

Efforts to detect this long-term response in sparse surface observations of rainfall and evaporation remain ambiguous. We show that ocean salinity patterns express an identifiable fingerprint of an intensifying water cycle. Our 50-year observed global surface salinity changes, combined with changes from global climate models, present robust evidence of an intensified global water cycle at a rate of 8 ± 5{\%} per degree of surface warming. This rate is double the response projected by current-generation climate models and suggests that a substantial (16 to 24{\%}) intensification of the global water cycle will occur in a future 2° to 3° warmer world.},

@techreport{Hibbert1965,
abstract = {Results are reported for thirty-nine studies of the effect of altering forest cover on water yield. Taken collectively, these studies reveal that forest reduction increases water yield, and that reforestation decreases water yield. Results of individual treatments vary widely and for the most part are unpredictable. First-year response to complete forest reduction varies from 34 mm to more than 450 mm of increased streamflow. A practical upper limit of yield increase appears to be about 4.5 mm per year for each percent reduction in forest cover, but most treatments produce less than half this amount. There is strong evidence that in well-watered regions, at least, streamflow response is proportional to reduction in forest cover. As the forest regrows following treatment, increases in streamflow decline; the rate of decline varies between catchments, but appears to be related to the rate of forest recovery. Seasonal distribution of streamflow response to treatment is variable; response in streamflow may be almost immediate or considerably delayed, depending on climate, soils, topography, and other factors.},

Ten of the meteorites contain abiotic macromolecular carbon (MMC) phases detected in association with small oxide grains included within high-temperature minerals. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were detected along with MMC phases in Dar al Gani 476. The association of organic carbon within magmatic minerals indicates that martian magmas favored precipitation of reduced carbon species during crystallization. The ubiquitous distribution of abiotic organic carbon in martian igneous rocks is important for understanding the martian carbon cycle and has implications for future missions to detect possible past martian life.},

abstract = {Community ecology and ecosystem ecology provide two perspectives on complex ecological systems that have largely complementary strengths and weaknesses. Merging the two perspectives is necessary both to ensure continued scientific progress and to provide society with the scientific means to face growing environmental challenges. Recent research on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning has contributed to this goal in several ways. By addressing a new question of high relevance for both science and society, by challenging existing paradigms, by tightly linking theory and experiments, by building scientific consensus beyond differences in opinion, by integrating fragmented disciplines and research fields, by connecting itself to other disciplines and management issues, it has helped transform ecology not only in content, but also in form. Creating a genuine evolutionary ecosystem ecology that links the evolution of species traits at the individual level, the dynamics of species interactions, and the overall functioning of ecosystems would give new impetus to this much-needed process of unification across ecological disciplines. Recent community evolution models are a promising step in that direction.},

abstract = {The N(2)O : N(2) product ratio of denitrification is negatively correlated with soil pH, but the mechanisms involved are not clear. We compared soils from field experiments where the pH had been maintained at different levels (pH 4.0-8.0) by liming ({\textgreater} or = 20 years), and quantified functional gene pools (nirS, nirK and nosZ), their transcription and gas kinetics (NO, N(2)O and N(2)) of denitrification as induced by anoxic incubation with and without a carbon substrate (glutamate). Denitrification in unamended soil appeared to be based largely on the activation of a pre-existing denitrification proteome, because constant rates of N(2) and N(2)O production were observed, and the transcription of functional genes was below the detection level. In contrast, glutamate-amended soils showed sharp peaks in the transcripts of nirS and nosZ, increasing the rates of denitrification and pH-dependent transient accumulation of N(2)O. The results indicate that the high N(2)O : N(2) product ratio at low pH is a post-transcriptional phenomenon, because the transcription rate of nosZ relative to that of nirS was higher at pH 6.1 than at pH 8.0. The most plausible explanation is that the translation/assembly of N(2)O reductase is more sensitive to low pH than that of the other reductases involved in denitrification.},

abstract = {In earlier work, we compared the amount of newly fixed nitrogen (N, as synthetic fertilizer and biologically fixed N) entering agricultural systems globally to the total emission of nitrous oxide (N(2)O). We obtained an N(2)O emission factor (EF) of 3-5{\%}, and applied it to biofuel production. For 'first-generation' biofuels, e.g. biodiesel from rapeseed and bioethanol from corn (maize), that require N fertilizer, N(2)O from biofuel production could cause (depending on N uptake efficiency) as much or more global warming as that avoided by replacement of fossil fuel by the biofuel. Our subsequent calculations in a follow-up paper, using published life cycle analysis (LCA) models, led to broadly similar conclusions. The N(2)O EF applies to agricultural crops in general, not just to biofuel crops, and has made possible a top-down estimate of global emissions from agriculture. Independent modelling by another group using bottom-up IPCC inventory methodology has shown good agreement at the global scale with our top-down estimate. Work by Davidson showed that the rate of accumulation of N(2)O in the atmosphere in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries was greater than that predicted from agricultural inputs limited to fertilizer N and biologically fixed N (Davidson, E. A. 2009 Nat. Geosci. 2, 659-662.). However, by also including soil organic N mineralized following land-use change and NO(x) deposited from the atmosphere in our estimates of the reactive N entering the agricultural cycle, we have now obtained a good fit between the observed atmospheric N(2)O concentrations from 1860 to 2000 and those calculated on the basis of a 4 per cent EF for the reactive N.},

abstract = {Interactions between natural selection and environmental change are well recognized and sit at the core of ecology and evolutionary biology. Reciprocal interactions between ecology and evolution, eco-evolutionary feedbacks, are less well studied, even though they may be critical for understanding the evolution of biological diversity, the structure of communities and the function of ecosystems. Eco-evolutionary feedbacks require that populations alter their environment (niche construction) and that those changes in the environment feed back to influence the subsequent evolution of the population. There is strong evidence that organisms influence their environment through predation, nutrient excretion and habitat modification, and that populations evolve in response to changes in their environment at time-scales congruent with ecological change (contemporary evolution). Here, we outline how the niche construction and contemporary evolution interact to alter the direction of evolution and the structure and function of communities and ecosystems. We then present five empirical systems that highlight important characteristics of eco-evolutionary feedbacks: rotifer-algae chemostats; alewife-zooplankton interactions in lakes; guppy life-history evolution and nutrient cycling in streams; avian seed predators and plants; and tree leaf chemistry and soil processes. The alewife-zooplankton system provides the most complete evidence for eco-evolutionary feedbacks, but other systems highlight the potential for eco-evolutionary feedbacks in a wide variety of natural systems.},

abstract = {Repeat topographic surveys are increasingly becoming more affordable, and possible at higher spatial resolutions and over greater spatial extents. Digital elevation models (DEMs) built from such surveys can be used to produce DEM of Difference (DoD) maps and estimate the net change in storage terms for morphological sediment budgets. While these products are extremely useful for monitoring and geomorphic interpretation, data and model uncertainties render them prone to misinterpretation. Two new methods are presented, which allow for more robust and spatially variable estimation of DEM uncertainties and propagate these forward to evaluate the consequences for estimates of geomorphic change. The first relies on a fuzzy inference system to estimate the spatial variability of elevation uncertainty in individual DEMs while the second approach modifies this estimate on the basis of the spatial coherence of erosion and deposition units. Both techniques allow for probabilistic representation of uncertainty on a cell-by-cell basis and thresholding of the sediment budget at a user-specified confidence interval. The application of these new techniques is illustrated with 5 years of high resolution survey data from a 1 km long braided reach of the River Feshie in the Highlands of Scotland. The reach was found to be consistently degradational, with between 570 and 1970 m3 of net erosion per annum, despite the fact that spatially, deposition covered more surface area than erosion. In the two wetter periods with extensive braid-plain inundation, the uncertainty analysis thresholded at a 95{\%} confidence interval resulted in a larger percentage (57{\%} for 2004-2005 and 59{\%} for 2006-2007) of volumetric change being excluded from the budget than the drier years (24{\%} for 2003-2004 and 31{\%} for 2005-2006). For these data, the new uncertainty analysis is generally more conservative volumetrically than a standard spatially-uniform minimum level of detection analysis, but also produces more plausible and physically meaningful results. The tools are packaged in a wizard-driven Matlab software application available for download with this paper, and can be calibrated and extended for application to any topographic point cloud (x,y,z).},

Here we show that smaller planetesimals also possess elevated HSE abundances in chondritic proportions. This demonstrates that late addition of chondritic material was a common feature of all differentiated planets and planetesimals, irrespective of when they accreted; occurring ≤5 to ≥150 million years after the formation of the solar system. Parent-body size played a role in producing variations in absolute HSE abundances among these bodies; however, the oxidation state of the body exerted the major control by influencing the extent to which late-accreted material was mixed into the silicate mantle rather than removed to the core.},

Lakes and streams in acid-vulnerable areas of northeastern North America have suffered substantial declines in acid-neutralizing capacity, the worst cases resulting in biological damage. Many invertebrates are very sensitive to acidification, with some disappearing at pH values as high as 6.0. However, the recent rate of acidification of lakes is slower than once predicted, in part the result of decreases in sulfur oxide emissions. A discussion of some of the processes that have contributed to the acidification of lakes as well as those that have protected acid-sensitive freshwaters is presented.

abstract = {The disciplines of geomorphology, hydrology, and hydrogeology have had a marked influence on the evolution of systems thinking in stream ecology. The River Continuum Concept was an explicit attempt to “translate the energy equilibrium theory from the physical system of geomorphologists into a biological analog” (Vannote et al. 1980, p. 131). A subsequent view of rivers as corridors evolved from an improved understanding of hydrologic linkages between rivers and their catchments and among channels, alluvial aquifers, and riparian zones/floodplains. More recently, the importance of channel network topology and dynamic, 3-dimensional hydrologic connectivity across fluvial landscapes has been emphasized by stream ecologists. This progression of ecological thinking provides a useful framework for understanding the role of fluvial geomorphology, channel hydrology, and hyporheic hydrology in shaping fundamental concepts of stream ecosystem science. This progression also defines a trajectory for understanding the potential role of the nascent discipline of stream hydrogeomorphology in contributing to an improved understanding of ecological responses to a stream's dynamic physical template. Although grounded in the discipline of stream ecology, J-NABS has contributed substantively to our understanding of interdisciplinary linkages among ecology, geomorphology, hydrology, and hydrogeology and, therefore, is well positioned as an outlet for ecologically based contributions to advances in stream hydrogeomorphology.},

@article{Pickett2004,
abstract = {Urban designers, ecologists, and social scientists have called for closer links among their disciplines. We examine a promising new tool for promoting this linkage - the metaphor of "cities of resilience." To put this tool to best use, we indicate how metaphor fits with other conceptual tools in science. We then present the two opposing definitions of resilience from ecology, and give reasons why one is more appropriate for linking with design. Additional specific tools and insights that are emerging from, or being increasingly used in, ecology can further support the linkage with urban design. These include recognizing the role of spatial heterogeneity in both ecological and social functioning of urban areas, the integrating power of watersheds, social and ecological patch dynamics of cities, the utility of spatial mosaic models to capture function, the use of an integrated "human ecosystem" modeling framework, and the consequent perspective of metropolitan areas as integrated ecological-social systems. Three additional tools are related to the adaptability of people and human institutions. First is the recognition of a "learning loop" in metropolitan ecosystems in which people respond to and affect ecological change, the use of urban design as experiments whose ecological and social outcomes can be measured, and finally the potency of a dialog between professionals and citizens, communities, and institutions, to support both research and design. The metaphor of resilience, and its technical specifications, draw these diverse strands for linking ecology and planning together. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Air pollution PM is associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In Appalachia, PM from mining may represent a health burden to this sensitive population that leads the nation in cardiovascular disease, among others. Cardiovascular consequences following inhalation of PM(MTM) are unclear, but must be identified to establish causal effects.

METHODS: PM was collected within 1 mile of an active MTM site in southern WV. The PM was extracted and was primarily {\textless}10 $\mu$m in diameter (PM10), consisting largely of sulfur (38{\%}) and silica (24{\%}). Adult male rats were IT with 300 $\mu$g PM(MTM) . Twenty-four hours following exposure, rats were prepared for intravital microscopy, or isolated arteriole experiments.

RESULTS: PM(MTM) exposure blunted endothelium-dependent dilation in mesenteric and coronary arterioles by 26{\%}, and 25{\%}, respectively, as well as endothelium-independent dilation. In vivo, PM(MTM) exposure inhibited endothelium-dependent arteriolar dilation (60{\%} reduction). $\alpha$-adrenergic receptor blockade inhibited PVNS-induced vasoconstriction in exposed animals compared with sham.

CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that PM(MTM) exposure impairs microvascular function in disparate microvascular beds, through alterations in NO-mediated dilation and sympathetic nerve influences. Microvascular dysfunction may contribute to cardiovascular disease in regions with MTM sites.},

abstract = {The influences of coal-mine hollow fills and associated settling ponds in three headwater streams were assessed in southern West Virginia, USA. Fill drainage waters had elevated conductivities and metal concentrations, compared to a regional reference. Benthic macroinvertebrate richness was not affected consistently by the hollow fill drainages, relative to a regional reference, although a more tolerant community, lacking in Ephemeroptera taxa at most locations, was evident. Collector-filterer populations were elevated at monitoring stations directly below the settling ponds, indicating that the ponds' presence influenced macroinvertebrate community structure by means of organic enrichment. Corbicula fluminea growth was enhanced in monitoring locations directly below the settling ponds, also an apparent result of organic enrichment. Results of acute water column toxicity testing with Ceriodaphnia dubia, sediment chronic toxicity testing with Daphnia magna, and in-situ ecotoxicological assessments with C. fluminea demonstrated no mortality or toxic influence at most of the sites tested below the ponds.

abstract = {1. Ontogenetic dispersal of animals has been observed among many ecosystems, but its full ecological significance is poorly understood. By modelling the consequences of ontogenetic reef fish dispersal between Caribbean mangroves and adjacent coral reefs, we quantify the broader implications of ecosystem connectivity for ecosystem function and resilience to climate-driven disturbance. 2. Mangrove-driven enrichment of parrotfish grazing on two coral reef habitats was calculated using empirical data. The consequences of increased grazing were then investigated using a spatial simulation of coral reef dynamics in shallow (depth 3–6 m) and mid-shelf forereefs (depth 7–15 m). 3. The largest increase in grazing occurred in shallow reefs, but was found to have negligible consequences for coral population dynamics. 4. In contrast, relatively weak increases in grazing on deeper reefs had profound consequences: reefs near mangroves were able to experience coral recovery under the most intense hurricane regimes of the Caribbean, whereas those lacking ecosystem connectivity had little capacity for recovery. 5. This surprising result occurs because reefs exhibit multiple stable equilibria and mangrove enrichment of grazing in mid-shelf reefs coincides with a zone of system instability. A small increase in grazing shifted the reef beyond a bifurcation point, thereby enhancing resilience massively. A relatively large increase in grazing in shallow reefs had minimal ecosystem consequence because the grazing levels concerned were more than double the levels needed to exceed the corresponding bifurcation point for this habitat. 6. Synthesis and applications . Caribbean mangroves are being deforested at a faster rate than rain- forests, yet their protective role against hurricane damage extends not only shoreward to coastal environments but also seaward to increasing the resilience of offshore coral reefs. Specifically, ontogenetic mechanisms of ecosystem connectivity involving parrotfish may increase the probability that coral populations will recover from climate-induced changes in hurricane disturbance. Efforts to arrest mangrove deforestation and restore mangrove habitats are likely to increase the likelihood of recovery of corals on mid-depth (7–15 m) reefs after disturbance. In general, the ecosystem-level consequences of ontogenetic migration do not correspond necessarily to the magnitude of locally observed effects (i.e. the pattern of grazer enrichment exhibited the opposite pattern to that of its consequences for system resilience). Therefore, caution must be exercised when interpreting the functional significance of changes in species abundance for ecosystem process (e.g. grazing pressure and its implications for coral growth and survival). Impacts of shifting abundance or process are perhaps best appreciated using mechanistic ecosystem models.},

abstract = {This study attempts to characterise the chemical weathering of basalts and to quantify the flux of carbon transferred from the atmosphere to the ocean during this major process at the surface of the Earth. To this aim, we have compiled different published chemical compositions of small rivers draining basalts. Basaltic river waters are characterised by relatively high Na-normalized molar ratios (Ca/Na: 0.2-3.9; HCO3/Na: 1-10; Mg/Na: 0.15-6) in comparison with those usually observed for river draining silicates. The data also show the climatic influence on basalt weathering and associated CO2 consumption. Runoff and temperature are the main parameters controlling the chemical weathering rate and derived CO2 consumption during basaltic weathering. From these relationships and digital maps, we are able to define the contribution of basalts to the global silicate flux. Taking account of this result, we estimate that the CO2 flux consumed by chemical weathering of basalts is about 4.08×1012 mol/year. The fluxes from the islands of Indonesia and regions of central America represent around 40{\%} of this flux. The global flux of CO2 consumed by chemical weathering of basalts represents between 30{\%} and 35{\%} of the flux derived from continental silicate determined by Gaillardet et al. [Chem. Geol. 159 (1999) 3]. Finally, it appears that volcanic activity not only acts as a major atmospheric CO2 source, but also creates strong CO2 sinks that cannot be neglected to better understand the geochemical and climatic evolution of the Earth. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Over the last decade we have seen an increased emphasis in environmental management and policies aimed at maintaining and restoring multiple ecosystem services at landscape scales. This emphasis has resulted from the recognition that management of specific environmental targets and ecosystem services requires an understanding of landscape processes and the spatial scales that maintain those targets and services. Moreover, we have become increasingly aware of the influence of broad-scale drivers such as climate change on landscape processes and the ecosystem services they support. Studies and assessments on the relative success of environmental policies and landscape designs in maintaining landscape processes and ecosystem services is mostly lacking. This likely reflects the relatively high cost of maintaining a commitment to implement and maintain monitoring programs that document responses of landscape processes and ecosystem services to different landscape policies and designs. However, we argue that there is considerable variation in natural and human-caused landscape pattern at local to continental scales and that this variation may facilitate analyses of how environmental targets and ecosystem services have responded to such patterns. Moreover, wall-to-wall spatial data on land cover and land use at national scales may permit characterization and mapping of different landscape pattern gradients. We discuss four broad and interrelated focus areas that should enhance our understanding of how landscape pattern influences ecosystem services: (1) characterizing and mapping landscape pattern gradients; (2) quantifying relationships between landscape patterns and environmental targets and ecosystem services, (3) evaluating landscape patterns with regards to multiple ecosystem services, and (4) applying adaptive management concepts to improve the effectiveness of specific landscape designs in sustaining ecosystem services. We discuss opportunities as well as challenges in each of these four areas. We believe that this agenda could lead to spatially explicit solutions in managing a range of environmental targets and ecosystem services. Spatially explicit options are critical in managing and protecting landscapes, especially given that communities and organizations are often limited in their capacity to make changes at landscape scales. The issues and potential solutions discussed in this paper expand upon the call by Nassauer and Opdam (Landscape Ecol 23:633–644, 2008) to include design as a fundamental element in landscape ecology research by evaluating natural and human-caused (planned or designed) landscape patterns and their influence on ecosystem services. It also expands upon the idea of “learning by doing” to include “learning from what has already been done.”},

abstract = {The ninth century collapse and abandonment of the Central Maya Lowlands in the Yucat{\'{a}}n peninsular region were the result of complex human-environment interactions. Large-scale Maya landscape alterations and demands placed on resources and ecosystem services generated high-stress environmental conditions that were amplified by increasing climatic aridity. Coincident with this stress, the flow of commerce shifted from land transit across the peninsula to sea-borne transit around it. These changing socioeconomic and environmental conditions generated increasing societal conflicts, diminished control by the Maya elite, and led to decisions to move elsewhere in the peninsular region rather than incur the high costs of maintaining the human-environment systems in place. After abandonment, the environment of the Central Maya Lowlands largely recovered, although altered from its state before Maya occupation; the population never recovered. This history and the spatial and temporal variability in the pattern of collapse and abandonment throughout the Maya lowlands support the case for different conditions, opportunities, and constraints in the prevailing human-environment systems and the decisions to confront them. The Maya case lends insights for the use of paleo- and historical analogs to inform contemporary global environmental change and sustainability.},

abstract = {Terrestrial ecosystems originate when particular plant species attain dominance at specific locations under specific environmental regimes. Ecosystems terminate, gradually or abruptly, when the dominant species or functional types are replaced by others, usually owing to environmental change or severe and irreversible disturbance. Assessing whether cur- rent ecosystems are sustainable in the face of future environ- mental change can be aided by examining the range of envi- ronmental variation those ecosystems have experienced in the past, and by determining the environmental conditions under which those ecosystems arose. The range of environmental variation depends on the time scale at which it is assessed. A narrow time span (e.g. 200-300 years) may underestimate the range of variation within which an ecosystem is sustainable, and it may also underestimate the risk of major transformation or disruption of that ecosystem by environmental change. Longer time spans (e.g. 1000-2000 years) increase the range of variation, by encompassing a larger sample of natural variability as well as non-stationary variability in the earth system. Most modern ecosystems disappear when the time span is expanded to 10000-15 000 years owing to secular changes in earth's climate system. Paleo-ecological records can pinpoint the time of origination of specific ecosystems, and paleo-environmental records can reveal the specific envi- ronmental changes that led to development of those ecosys- tems and the range of environmental variation under which those ecosystems have maintained themselves in the past. This information can help identify critical environmental thresh- olds beyond which specific modern ecosystems can no longer be sustained.},

abstract = {Nitrous oxide (N(2)O) is a potent greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change and stratospheric ozone destruction. Anthropogenic nitrogen (N) loading to river networks is a potentially important source of N(2)O via microbial denitrification that converts N to N(2)O and dinitrogen (N(2)). The fraction of denitrified N that escapes as N(2)O rather than N(2) (i.e., the N(2)O yield) is an important determinant of how much N(2)O is produced by river networks, but little is known about the N(2)O yield in flowing waters. Here, we present the results of whole-stream (15)N-tracer additions conducted in 72 headwater streams draining multiple land-use types across the United States. We found that stream denitrification produces N(2)O at rates that increase with stream water nitrate (NO(3)(-)) concentrations, but that {\textless}1{\%} of denitrified N is converted to N(2)O. Unlike some previous studies, we found no relationship between the N(2)O yield and stream water NO(3)(-). We suggest that increased stream NO(3)(-) loading stimulates denitrification and concomitant N(2)O production, but does not increase the N(2)O yield. In our study, most streams were sources of N(2)O to the atmosphere and the highest emission rates were observed in streams draining urban basins. Using a global river network model, we estimate that microbial N transformations (e.g., denitrification and nitrification) convert at least 0.68 Tg{\textperiodcentered}y(-1) of anthropogenic N inputs to N(2)O in river networks, equivalent to 10{\%} of the global anthropogenic N(2)O emission rate. This estimate of stream and river N(2)O emissions is three times greater than estimated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.},

abstract = {Results from chronosequences from the arctic to the tropics show that phosphorus (P) availability, total P, and the fraction of bedrock-derived P remaining in soil diminishes as soils age. Thus we predict that ecosystems mantling old substrates are likely to have low available P. Yet there are myriad examples in the biogeochemical literature where the results from chronosequences are used to argue the reverse, and ecosystems observed to be P poor are assumed to mantle an old substrate. This premise is difficult to test, for while the concept of substrate age is useful on uneroded surfaces that formed at a particular time, it becomes obscured in denuding landscapes, where substrate ages instead reflect the rates of rock weathering, denudation and mixing of dust into soil. Here we explore this premise as it relates to one of the most ubiquitous assumptions in the biogeochemical literature: that the differences in nitrogen (N) and P cycling between temperate and tropical regions are driven by gradients in substrate age. We build a conceptual framework for quantifying the fraction of parent material P remaining in soil ([SoilP]/[RockP]), by estimating P inputs (rock weathering and dust deposition) and outputs (P leaching). We parameterize our model with spatially explicit (0.5A degrees) estimates of global denudation, weathering zone thickness, and P deposition. To test the assumption that latitudinal gradients in P status are the result of soil age, we apply a single P loss rate, derived from a humid tropical system in the Hawaiian Islands, to our spatially explicit map of soil residence times. Surprisingly, in this formulation, we find only a modest latitudinal gradient in soil P depletion, with mean depletion values in the humid tropics {\textless} 2x greater than in the previously unglaciated humid temperate zone. This small latitudinal gradient in P depletion is unlikely to be sufficient to drive the observed differences in tropical vs. temperate ecosystem stoichiometry (e.g. trends in foliar and litter N:P). Thus our results suggest that, to the extent P depletion is greater in the tropics, the appropriate conceptual model for attributing causation may not be one of a chronosequence where time is the primary driver of P loss. We hypothesize that the covariation of inferred P availability with latitude may be strongly controlled by latitudinal changes in rates of P leaching and occlusion, rather than gradients in substrate age.},

abstract = {The high altitudes of most mountain ranges have commonly been ascribed to late Cenozoic uplift, without reference to when crustal thickening and other tectonic processes occurred. Deep incision and recent denudation of these mountain ranges, abundant late Cenozoic coarse sediment near them, and palaeobotanical evidence for warmer climates, where high mountain climates today are relatively cold, have traditionally been interpreted as evidence for recent uplift. An alternative cause of these phenomena is late Cenozoic global climate change: towards lower temperatures, increased alpine glaciation, a stormier climate, and perturbations to humidity, vegetative cover and precipitation.},

abstract = {The distributions of many terrestrial organisms are currently shifting in latitude or elevation in response to changing climate. Using a meta-analysis, we estimated that the distributions of species have recently shifted to higher elevations at a median rate of 11.0 meters per decade, and to higher latitudes at a median rate of 16.9 kilometers per decade. These rates are approximately two and three times faster than previously reported. The distances moved by species are greatest in studies showing the highest levels of warming, with average latitudinal shifts being generally sufficient to track temperature changes. However, individual species vary greatly in their rates of change, suggesting that the range shift of each species depends on multiple internal species traits and external drivers of change. Rapid average shifts derive from a wide diversity of responses by individual species.},

abstract = {The evolution of a subdivided population depends on whether subpopulations with high mean fitness make a greater per capita contribution to the next generation than subpopulations with lower mean fitness. I distinguish two different models of ecological population structure, denoted local compensation and global compensation. Local compensation restricts the differential contribution of subpopulations, whereas global compensation allows subpopulations to contribute in direct proportion to their mean fitness. I describe a simple regression-based method that distinguishes these alternatives as points on a continuum of possible population structures. The method is applied to field measurements of local abundance and reproduction in a subdivided population of the annual plant Impatiens capensis. These data suggest that the global compensation model is a more accurate description of the population studied. This result is surprising because local density effects on growth and reproduction occur in I. capensis. The implications of ecological population structure for bath geographical variation in selection and kin selection are discussed. [References: 52]},

abstract = {(1) Successional convergence in community composition was examined in terms of three questions: (i) for a given site is there a continuous shift in composition toward that characteristic of climax? (ii) does variation in community composition along an environmental gradient increase or decrease with succession? (iii) to what extent is the species composition along a successional gradient determined by site characteristics rather than by chance factors? Hypotheses regarding the nature of successional convergence are reviewed in terms of these questions. (2) These hypotheses were tested using data for tree ({\textgreater} 0.5 cm dbh) and herb (all foliage {\$}{\textless} 1 m{\$} tall) abundance from 191 upland forest stands on the North Carolina piedmont which were grouped in five successional age classes (20-40-, 40-60-, 60-80-, and {\$}{\textgreater}80{\$}-yr-old pines, and uneven-aged hardwoods). For each age-group first axis ordination scores (detrended correspondence analysis) were highly correlated most consistently with soil pH as compared with other soil and site variables. This correlation was greatest in the intermediate-age (40-60- and 60-80-yr-old) pines and in the hardwood stands, and lowest in old pine stands. The distribution of species in the ordination space was most similar between the intermediate-age pine stands and the hardwoods; in contrast, young and old pine age classes were dissimilar to hardwoods. Species distributions in relation to the soil pH gradient were also most similar between intermediate-age pines and hardwoods. Thus, there is a shift in species composition toward that characteristic of climax, but it is probably not monotonic. (3) Beta-diversity was highest in the hardwoods and lowest among the pines. Community differentiation along gradients increased in this chronosequence. (4) Predictability of soil pH, based on stand species composition, was highest in the intermediate-age pines and in the hardwoods. Habitat breadth in relation to soil pH decreased steadily with successional age. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the role of chance factors (e.g. site history and seed rain) decreases with successional age.},

abstract = {Selection at the population level or group selection is defined as genetic change that is brought about or maintained by the differential extinction and/or proliferation of populations. Group selection for both increased and de- creased adult population size was carried out among laboratory populations of Tribolium castaneum at 37-day intervals. The effect of individual selection within populations on adult population size was evaluated in an additional control series of populations. The response in the group selection treatments occurred rapidly, within three or four generations, and was large in magnitude, at times differing from the controls by over 200{\%}. This response to selection at the populational level occurred despite strong individual selection which caused a decline in the mean size of the control populations from over 200 adults to near 50 adults in nine 37-day intervals. "Assay" experiments indicated that selective changes in fecundity, developmental time, body weight, and cannibalism rates were responsible in part for the observed treatment differences in adult population size. These findings have implications in terms of speciation in organisms whose range is composed of many partially isolated local populations.},

abstract = {Elevated concentrations of HCO3−, Cl−, SO42−, Mg2+, Na+, and Ca2+ in freshwater ecosystems are often associated with anthropogenic disturbances. The US Environmental Protection Agency developed a field-based specific conductance (SC) benchmark of 300 $\mu$S/cm for streams affected by mountain-top mining operations. The benchmark has been criticized because of the potential influence of confounding variables and difficulty in demonstrating a causal relationship between elevated SC and macroinvertebrate responses. We conducted 4 stream mesocosm experiments to quantify the effects of major ions on aquatic insect assemblages. We exposed insects from streams with low (60–72 $\mu$S/cm) and moderate (200–250 $\mu$S/cm) SC to major ions at values bracketing 300 $\mu$S/cm. We measured community metabolism, macroinvertebrate drift, community composition, and survival. Sixty-six taxa were exposed to NaHCO3, MgSO4, and NaCl in 4 mesocosm experiments, and 8 dominant families/subfamilies occurred in sufficient densities to develop SC-response relationships. Significant SC-response relationships occurred for each major ion tested. Drift increased and community metabolism decreased with increasing SC. Ephemeroptera were highly sensitive, whereas Trichoptera and Diptera were relatively tolerant. EC20 values (the SC that resulted in a 20{\%} difference from controls) ranged from 151 to 3615 $\mu$S/cm and were {\textgreater}300 $\mu$S/cm for most endpoints. Mayfly drift, abundance of baetid and heptageniid mayflies, total mayfly abundance, and community metabolism were affected at SC levels near or {\textless}300 $\mu$S/cm. EC20 values were lower for NaHCO3 and MgSO4 than for NaCl, indicating greater toxicity of these 2 salts. Effects were greater on communities from the low- than the high-SC stream. Thus, accounting for context-dependent responses may be important when establishing contaminant benchmarks or thresholds. The 300-$\mu$S/cm benchmark is protective of aquatic insect communities in naturally low-conductivity streams.},

abstract = {n the past 100,000 years, many of the largest animals on Earth became extinct. The reasons for these megafaunal extinctions remain contentious (1, 2). In 1967, Martin suggested that within a few hundred years of their arrival, fast-moving bands of hunters eliminated the big game by overkill (3). Similarly, Flannery claimed in the 1990s that the current fire-swept Australian landscape with its impoverished soils was created by human elimination of massive marsupial browsers and grazers (4, 5). However, a diverse array of counter-hypotheses has been proposed; the leading argument is that habitat loss through climate change or fire was the critical blow to many large animals (6). The loss of 55 large mammal species in Australia (see the figure), shortly after humans arrived ∼45,000 years ago (7), provides a key test case. On page 1483 of this issue, Rule et al. (8) present new results from tropical Australia supporting the idea that hunting alone was responsible.},

In 2018, the European Union (EU) will prohibit state coal subsidies and the local population is already deeply divided, and the atmosphere confrontational. Drawing on ethnography, interviews, and document analysis, this article explores the narrative variations-"disease," "traitor," "lazy foreigner," and "salon environmentalist"-characterising environmentalists as scapegoats, and the importance of these social processes for building an ecological resistance movement in a historical coal mining area. The article concludes that, as in related conflicts elsewhere, violence against those criticising MTR practices, as well as a "culture of silence," have strongly limited the success of the anti-MTR movement.},

Ecological restoration may occur through different activities: 1) rehabilitating disaster areas; 2) increasing the production capacity of degraded land; 3) improving the quality of existing nature reserves; and 4) enhancing the conservation of nature. But what can be done when degradation is extreme? Creation of new ecosystems (designer ecosystems) may be the only way. The goal of this special issue is threefold: 1) to consider how a perspective of ecosystem functioning may be realistically used in a restoration or ecological design context; 2) to evaluate the extent to which ecosystem services are being re-established in degraded habitats; and 3) to assess whether designed ecosystems are successfully fulfilling the expectations of restoration ecology in terms of structure and ecosystem function. Several examples of innovative recent studies of designer ecosystems focused both on plants and animals are presented. These involve tropical and temperate forests, riparian trees along urban streams, wetlands, and coastal dunes. In addition, the relevance of natural ecosystem dynamics for restoration projects and designer ecosystems is reviewed.},

abstract = {Hierarchies and adaptive cycles comprise the basis of ecosystems and social-ecological systems across scales. Together they form a panarchy. The panar- chy describes how a healthy system can invent and experiment, benefiting from inventions that create opportunity while being kept safe from those that destabilize because of their nature or excessive ex- uberance. Each level is allowed to operate at its own pace, protected from above by slower, larger levels but invigorated from below by faster, smaller cycles of innovation. The whole panarchy is therefore both creative and conserving. The interactions be- tween cycles in a panarchy combine learning with continuity. An analysis of this process helps to clar- ify the meaning of "sustainable development." Sus- tainability is the capacity to create, test, and main- tain adaptive capability. Development is the process of creating, testing, and maintaining opportunity. The phrase that combines the two, "sustainable de- velopment," thus refers to the goal of fostering adaptive capabilities and creating opportunities. It is therefore not an oxymoron but a term that de- scribes a logical partnership},

abstract = {The United States' use of coal results in many environmental alterations. In the Appalachian coal belt region, one widespread alteration is conversion of forest to reclaimed mineland. The goal of this study was to quantify the changes to ecosystem structure and function associated with a conversion from forest to reclaimed mine grassland by comparing a small watershed containing a 15-year-old reclaimed mine with a forested, reference watershed in western Maryland. Major differences were apparent between the two watersheds in terms of biogeochemistry. Total C, N, and P pools were all substantially lower at the mined site, mainly due to the removal of woody biomass but also, in the case of P, to reductions in soil pools. Mineral soil C, N, and P pools were 96{\%}, 79{\%}, and 69{\%} of native soils, respectively. Although annual runoff from the watersheds was similar, the mined watershed exhibited taller, narrower storm peaks as a result of a higher soil bulk density and decreased infiltration rates. Stream export of N was much lower in the mined watershed due to lower net nitrification rates and nitrate concentrations in soil. However, stream export of sediment and P and summer stream temperature were much higher. Stream leaf decomposition was reduced and macroinvertebrate community structure was altered as a result of these changes to the stream environment. This land use change leads to substantial, long-term changes in ecosystem capital and function.},

abstract = {Mechanical thinning for fire mitigation has become increasingly widespread in recent years throughout the western United States. A common practice in fire-mitigation procedures is the conversion of slash into chipped mulch (referred to as “woodchips”) that is spread on-site. Here, we investigated: (1) the effect of woodchip amendments on soil nitrogen availability, and (2) the influence of potential interactions between woodchip amendments and soil nitrogen availability on patterns of understory plant establishment in a thinned montane forest in the Front Range of Colorado. We created a gradient of soil nitrogen availability among experimental plots by applying sugar to reduce plant-available nitrogen and applying ammonium nitrate to increase plant-available nitrogen. Soil and resin bag analyses confirmed the effectiveness of the nitrogen manipulations. Nitrogen manipulations did not affect understory species richness or diversity, but increased nitrogen availability promoted a disproportionate increase in the cover of non-native forbs over the three-year post-treatment interval. Woodchips did not alter inorganic nitrogen availability at ambient levels of soil fertility during the first two years of the study, but were associated with increased soil N availability in the third growing season. Woodchip additions were associated with significantly lower species richness, diversity, and overall plant cover than found in unchipped plots. The observed reduction in plant cover affected native and non-native species similarly, although certain species had distinctive responses to woodchip amendments. On the whole, woodchips excluded more species than they promoted, and the physical effects of woodchips appeared to be more important than soil nitrogen status in influencing the understory composition of this area following thinning. At this site, approximately 60{\%} of the plant cover in the three years following thinning operations was comprised of non-native plant species. Thus, the thinning activity, itself, promoted non-native understory plant species cover, but the application of woodchip mulch reduced vegetation cover and native species richness relative to the thinned areas that did not receive woodchips. This effect was largely independent of soil nitrogen availability during the first three years following thinning.},

abstract = {A species is expected to occur where the prevailing biotic and abiotic conditions fall within its fundamental niche. Geographic range limits should, therefore, occur when the survival and fitness of individuals along ecological gradients is reduced to the point at which populations are no longer self-sustaining. Abrupt limits to a species' distribution are expected to reflect abrupt changes in the ecological conditions that cause sharp declines in fitness across the limit. We investigated the correlation between geographic variation in environment and fitness across the abrupt northern range limit of a coastal dune plant, Camissoniopsis cheiranthifolia (Onagraceae). In each of 64 plots distributed across five sites along a 200-km transect spanning the species' northern range limit (four within the range plus one beyond the limit), we measured plant community composition as a proxy for variation in biotic and abiotic environmental factors and lifetime fitness of genetically standardized experimental populations of C. cheiranthifolia. There was substantial variation in plant community composition among plots and sites across the range limit, and fitness of experimental plants covaried strongly with the first principal component of plant community composition. However, we did not detect an abrupt shift in plant community or the expected decline in fitness across the range limit. In fact, fitness and recruitment increased toward the limit and were relatively high beyond the limit. This suggests that habitat beyond the range did not occur outside of the species' fundamental niche. These results challenge niche-based explanations for range limits and suggest that hypotheses involving the finer-scale distribution of habitat patches or constraints on dispersal warrant more serious consideration.},

@article{Olander2014,
abstract = {As early as 1995, the Convention on Biological Diversity adopted an integrated ecosystems approach to natural resource management in order to promote conservation, to ensure equitable and sustainable use, and to account for the goods and services that nature provides to people. Twenty years on, how far have we come in incorporating nature's benefits in decision making, and where do we go from here? The US and the European Union (EU) are moving rapidly toward integrating the assessment of ecosystem services (ES) into their decision-making processes. Potential applications range from where to site energy infrastructure and how to prioritize new restoration projects to the ways we assess the environmental and human risks of new and existing chemicals and consider nature-based or “green” buildings as we replace aging infrastructure and adapt to climate change.   In 2008, the US incorporated the ES concept into rules for compensatory mitigation of degraded aquatic resources. Four years later, in 2012, the US Forest Service instituted a rule requesting that an ES assessment be incorporated into all agency-related planning involving national forests and grasslands. And in 2013, the White House Council on Environmental Quality released new principles and requirements for federal spending on water resource and infrastructure projects that also require an assessment of ES. Several federal agencies – including the US Army Corps of Engineers; the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; and the US Department of the Interior, which includes the US Bureau of Land Management and the US Fish and Wildlife Service – have started to develop guidance within the past few years on integrating the ES concept into their respective decision making.   The US is not alone in recognizing the need to reflect ES in its decision making. In 2011, the EU published its Biodiversity Strategy, which set 2020 as a target for halting the loss of biodiversity and degradation of ES in EU Member States. The strategy is being implemented through relevant EU policies; one such policy is the Marine Strategy Framework Directive, which outlines a clear legislative agenda for managing human activities and supporting sustainable use of marine resources through an ecosystem-based approach. As recently as last year, the EU also adopted a green infrastructure strategy, which recognizes that rural and urban lands alike provide multiple ES and promotes green infrastructure projects through agricultural, economic, and environmental policies, as well as in disaster risk management efforts.   This welcomed adoption of an ES-based decision-making approach is not without its challenges, including implementing such requirements, better understanding how human activities affect ES, and quantifying the ways in which people use, appreciate, and value nature's benefits.   A recent joint workshop – hosted by the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry and the Ecological Society of America – at the National Conservation Training Center (Shepherdstown, WV) brought together international scientists from academia, government, and business to develop practical guidance for applying the ES concept to environmental decision making. One of the main conclusions from that workshop was that ecological production functions (EPFs), which translate ecological changes into outcomes that people use or value, are key to determining how anthropogenic impacts on ecosystems translate into changes in ES delivery. Another conclusion was that the complexity of natural systems can make it difficult to effectively and consistently incorporate ES considerations into decision making. Ultimately, that task will require governments and other partners to collect the pertinent data, develop EPF models, and, ideally, devise user-friendly decision-making tools, all of which can be shared through a well-maintained online network. Important efforts laying the foundations for consistency in methods and use include: the US Environmental Protection Agency's EnviroAtlas (http://enviroatlas.epa.gov), the National Ecosystem Services Partnership's Federal Resource Management and Ecosystem Services Guidebook (www.nespguidebook.com), the European Commission's Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and their Services project (http://biodiversity.europa.eu/maes), and the United Nations Environment Programme's initiative The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (www.teebweb.org).   Despite lingering questions about how to quantify, assess, and value ES, and the challenges involved in developing EPF models, it is important to move forward with efforts to incorporate ES considerations in decision making. Doing so will help us understand not only where and how to apply the ES concept in decision making but also how to develop useful common metrics and measures. Every application encourages forward momentum and adds to our understanding of the relationship between ecosystem change and ES production and value. The result will be an improved awareness and consideration of the policy-related impacts on the ES upon which all life depends.},

abstract = {The response of ecological communities to anthropogenic disturbance is of both scientific and practical interest. Communities where all species respond to disturbance in a similar fashion (synchrony) will exhibit large fluctuations in total biomass and dramatic changes in ecosystem function. Communities where some species increase in abundance while others decrease after disturbance (compensation) can maintain total biomass and ecosystem function in the face of anthropogenic change. We examined dynamics of the Little Rock Lake (Wisconsin, USA) zooplankton community in the context of an experimental pH manipulation conducted in one basin of the lake. A novel application of wavelets was used to partition patterns of synchrony and compensation by time scale. We find interestingly that some time series show both patterns of synchrony and compensation depending on the scale of analysis. Within the unmanipulated basin, we found subtle patterns of synchrony and compensation within the community, largely at a one-year time scale corresponding to seasonal variation. Within the acidified lake basin, dynamics shifted to longer time scales corresponding to the pattern of pH manipulation. Comparisons between pairs of species in different functional groups showed both strong compensatory and synchronous responses to disturbance. The strongest compensatory signal was observed for two species of Daphnia whose life history traits lead to synchrony at annual time scales, but whose differential sensitivity to acidification led to compensation at multiannual time scales. The separation of time scales inherent in the wavelet method greatly facilitated interpretation as patterns resulting from seasonal drivers could be separated from patterns driven by pH manipulation.},

abstract = {Although the concept of self-design is frequently employed in restoration, reestablishment of primary physical drivers does not always result in a restored ecosystem having the desired ecological functions that support system resilience and stability. We investigated the use of a primary environmental driver in coastal salt marshes, sediment availability, as a means of promoting the resilience and stability of submerging deltaic salt marshes, which are rapidly subsiding due to natural and human-induced processes. We conducted a disturbance-recovery experiment across a gradient of sediment slurry addition to assess the roles of sediment elevation and soil physico-chemical characteristics on vegetation resilience and stability in two restored salt marshes of differing age (a 15-year-old site and a 5-year-old site). Salt marshes that received moderate intensities of sediment slurry addition with elevations at the mid to high intertidal zone (2-11 cm above local mean sea level; MSL) were more resilient than natural marshes. The primary regulator of enhanced resilience and stability in the restored marshes was the alleviation of flooding stress observed in the natural, unsubsidized marsh. However, stability reached a sediment addition threshold, at an elevation of 11 cm above MSL, with decreasing stability in marshes above this elevation. Declines in resilience and stability above the sediment addition threshold were principally influenced by relatively dry conditions that resulted from insufficient and infrequent flooding at high elevations. Although the older restored marsh has subsided over time, areas receiving too much sediment still had limited stability 15 years later, emphasizing the importance of applying the appropriate amount of sediment to the marsh. In contrast, treated marshes with elevations 2-11 cm above MSL were still more resilient than the natural marsh 15 years after restoration, illustrating that when performed correctly, sediment slurry addition can be a sustainable restoration technique.},

This study compares surveys conducted in the months following the disaster with surveys administered 10 years later to determine the long-term impacts of the disaster on trust in government, corporations, and experts. We find that the social trust levels in Martin County partially recovered in the 10 years since the impoundment rupture. This suggests that technological disasters, including those that result in toxic contamination, do not always permanently damage the social fabric of the communities that experience them. However, some factors suggest that Martin County's recovery in trust may be unwarranted, which, in turn, raises concerns about this community's susceptibility to environmental hazards and possible future disasters. {\textcopyright} 2012 SAGE Publications.},

abstract = {Graph theory is a body of mathematics dealing with problems of connectivity, flow, and routing in networks ranging from social groups to computer networks. Recently, network applications have erupted in many fields, and graph models are now being applied in landscape ecology and conservation biology, particularly for applications couched in metapopulation theory. In these applications, graph nodes represent habitat patches or local populations and links indicate functional connections among populations (i.e. via dispersal). Graphs are models of more complicated real systems, and so it is appropriate to review these applications from the perspective of modelling in general. Here we review recent applications of network theory to habitat patches in landscape mosaics. We consider (1) the conceptual model underlying these applications; (2) formalization and implementation of the graph model; (3) model parameterization; (4) model testing, insights, and predictions available through graph analyses; and (5) potential implications for conservation biology and related applications. In general, and for a variety of ecological systems, we find the graph model a remarkably robust framework for applications concerned with habitat connectivity. We close with suggestions for further work on the parameterization and validation of graph models, and point to some promising analytic insights.},

abstract = {Climate exerts a powerful influence on biological processes, but the effects of climate change on ecosystem nutrient flux and cycling are poorly resolved. Although rare, long-term records offer a unique opportunity to disentangle effects of climate from other anthropogenic influences. Here, we examine the longest and most complete record of watershed nutrient and climate dynamics available worldwide, which was collected at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in the northeastern United States. We used empirical analyses and model calculations to distinguish between effects of climate change and past perturbations on the forest nitrogen (N) cycle. We find that climate alone cannot explain the occurrence of a dramatic {\textgreater}90{\%} drop in watershed nitrate export over the past 46 y, despite longer growing seasons and higher soil temperatures. The strongest climate influence was an increase in soil temperature accompanied by a shift in paths of soil water flow within the watershed, but this effect explained, at best, only ∼40{\%} of the nitrate decline. In contrast, at least 50-60{\%} of the observed change in the N export could be explained by the long-lasting effect of forest cutting in the early 1900s on the N cycle of the soil and vegetation pools. Our analysis shows that historic events can obscure the influence of modern day stresses on the N cycle, even when analyses have the advantage of being informed by 0.5-century-long datasets. These findings raise fundamental questions about interpretations of long-term trends as a baseline for understanding how climate change influences complex ecosystems.},

abstract = {The biogeochemical cycles of H, C, N, O and S are coupled via biologically catalysed electron transfer (redox) reactions. The metabolic processes responsible for maintaining these cycles evolved over the first ca 2.3 Ga of Earth's history in prokaryotes and, through a sequence of events, led to the production of oxygen via the photobiologically catalysed oxidation of water. However, geochemical evidence suggests that there was a delay of several hundred million years before oxygen accumulated in Earth's atmosphere related to changes in the burial efficiency of organic matter and fundamental alterations in the nitrogen cycle. In the latter case, the presence of free molecular oxygen allowed ammonium to be oxidized to nitrate and subsequently denitrified. The interaction between the oxygen and nitrogen cycles in particular led to a negative feedback, in which increased production of oxygen led to decreased fixed inorganic nitrogen in the oceans. This feedback, which is supported by isotopic analyses of fixed nitrogen in sedimentary rocks from the Late Archaean, continues to the present. However, once sufficient oxygen accumulated in Earth's atmosphere to allow nitrification to out-compete denitrification, a new stable electron 'market' emerged in which oxygenic photosynthesis and aerobic respiration ultimately spread via endosymbiotic events and massive lateral gene transfer to eukaryotic host cells, allowing the evolution of complex (i.e. animal) life forms. The resulting network of electron transfers led a gas composition of Earth's atmosphere that is far from thermodynamic equilibrium (i.e. it is an emergent property), yet is relatively stable on geological time scales. The early coevolution of the C, N and O cycles, and the resulting non-equilibrium gaseous by-products can be used as a guide to search for the presence of life on terrestrial planets outside of our Solar System.},

Sephenson (Guest-Editors), Contemporary Hydrogeology — The George Burke Maxey Memorial Volume. J. Hydrol., 43: 347-354. Throughout much of the Appalachian region, heavy rainfall leads not only to flooding but also to extensive erosion and landsliding. Such a heavy rainfall occurred on August 18, 1972, in south western West Virginia with the heaviest rainfall and resultant damage centered over the Gilbert and Bens Creek drainages. Landslides, in the form of debris avalanches, were the principal form of mass movement during the storm. A number of these landslides appear to have resulted from soil zone saturation associated with temporary spring flows issuing from bedrock to the soil mantle where joints in highly fractured shales and coal beds intersected underlying, relatively unjointed, sandstones. Thus, it appears that, in this case, increased pore-water pressures as an effect of concentration of flow through secondary permeability played a substantial role in the localization and formation of slide masses. How widespread this phenomenon may be is not known. {\textcopyright} 1979, Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {'Replaying the tape' is an intriguing 'would it happen again?' exercise. With respect to broad evolutionary innovations, such as photosynthesis, the answers are central to our search for life elsewhere. Photosynthesis permits a large planetary biomass on Earth. Specifically, oxygenic photosynthesis has allowed an oxygenated atmosphere and the evolution of large metabolically demanding creatures, including ourselves. There are at least six prerequisites for the evolution of biological carbon fixation: a carbon-based life form; the presence of inorganic carbon; the availability of reductants; the presence of light; a light-harvesting mechanism to convert the light energy into chemical energy; and carboxylating enzymes. All were present on the early Earth. To provide the evolutionary pressure, organic carbon must be a scarce resource in contrast to inorganic carbon. The probability of evolving a carboxylase is approached by creating an inventory of carbon-fixation enzymes and comparing them, leading to the conclusion that carbon fixation in general is basic to life and has arisen multiple times. Certainly, the evolutionary pressure to evolve new pathways for carbon fixation would have been present early in evolution. From knowledge about planetary systems and extraterrestrial chemistry, if organic carbon-based life occurs elsewhere, photosynthesis -- although perhaps not oxygenic photosynthesis -- would also have evolved.},

abstract = {The stable isotope ratios of atmospheric CO(2) ((18)O/(16)O and (13)C/(12)C) have been monitored since 1977 to improve our understanding of the global carbon cycle, because biosphere-atmosphere exchange fluxes affect the different atomic masses in a measurable way. Interpreting the (18)O/(16)O variability has proved difficult, however, because oxygen isotopes in CO(2) are influenced by both the carbon cycle and the water cycle. Previous attention focused on the decreasing (18)O/(16)O ratio in the 1990s, observed by the global Cooperative Air Sampling Network of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Earth System Research Laboratory. This decrease was attributed variously to a number of processes including an increase in Northern Hemisphere soil respiration; a global increase in C(4) crops at the expense of C(3) forests; and environmental conditions, such as atmospheric turbulence and solar radiation, that affect CO(2) exchange between leaves and the atmosphere. Here we present 30 years' worth of data on (18)O/(16)O in CO(2) from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography global flask network and show that the interannual variability is strongly related to the El Ni{\~{n}}o/Southern Oscillation. We suggest that the redistribution of moisture and rainfall in the tropics during an El Ni{\~{n}}o increases the (18)O/(16)O ratio of precipitation and plant water, and that this signal is then passed on to atmospheric CO(2) by biosphere-atmosphere gas exchange. We show how the decay time of the El Ni{\~{n}}o anomaly in this data set can be useful in constraining global gross primary production. Our analysis shows a rapid recovery from El Ni{\~{n}}o events, implying a shorter cycling time of CO(2) with respect to the terrestrial biosphere and oceans than previously estimated. Our analysis suggests that current estimates of global gross primary production, of 120 petagrams of carbon per year, may be too low, and that a best guess of 150-175 petagrams of carbon per year better reflects the observed rapid cycling of CO(2). Although still tentative, such a revision would present a new benchmark by which to evaluate global biospheric carbon cycling models.},

Whether Brown was a great artist, opinions may differ. However, there is evidence that Brown was an outstandingly successful businessman. From humble origins, Brown ultimately created a business that seized the lion's share of the landscaping market of Britain's elite in the second half of the eighteenth century, counting half of the House of Lords as his clients. A study of Brown's surviving account book, bank ledgers, and personal correspondence provides new insight into the rapid development, vast scale, and nature of his business. This research shows that commissions were not just gained due to his skills in landscaping, but through his exceptional business acumen, his method of operations, organizational structure, focus, work ethic, and ability to develop contacts and win trust with both the aristocracy and ultimately the King of England. What emerges is a picture of Brown as an entrepreneur of considerable skill, enabling him to uniquely build a national landscaping business.},

Prior authors suggested that Brown's designs reflected the influence of Hogarth. Twentieth-century stream restoration projects in North America have been characterised by highly sinuous and symmetrical curves. Comparing the sinuosity and symmetry of Brown's eighteenth-century water features, twentieth-century stream restoration projects, and Hogarth's line of beauty, we found Brown's features matched Hogarth's line in sinuosity but were asymmetrical, while the recent stream restoration project designs had higher sinuosities and were nearly perfectly symmetrical.},

abstract = {1.In river corridors, water plays a key role in connecting various landscape patches. This ‘hydrological connectivity' operates on the four dimensions of fluvial hydrosystems: longitudinal, lateral, vertical, and temporal. The present review focuses on: (1) lateral connectivity that links the main course of a river with floodplain waterbodies; and (2) vertical connectivity, the exchanges between the surface and groundwater via infiltration into the alluvial aquifer and exfiltration of phreatic water from the hillslope aquifer. 2. The biocomplexity of fluvial hydrosystems results from interactions between processes operating at various spatial and temporal scales. Differences in the nature and intensity of hydrological connectivity contribute to the spatial heterogeneity of riverine floodplains, which results in high alpha, beta and gamma diversity. Differences in connectivity also provide complementary habitats that are required for the parts of life cycles and life-cycles of some species. Hydrological connectivity also produces antagonistic effects, even within the same waterbody. 3. Two temporal scales are distinguished in connectivity dynamics. River level fluctuations within years lead to a pulsing connectivity that drives the functioning of floodplain ecosystems, namely the exchange of organic matter and inorganic nutrients and the shift between production and transport phases. On the scale of decades to centuries, the interactions between various processes increase the biocomplexity of floodplains; for example, river dynamics, which create highly connected waterbodies, compensate for succession that tends towards disconnection. Alternatively, river-bed incision leads to the reduction of fluvial dynamics and to the disconnection of waterbodies, although river incision may increase vertical connectivity where waterbodies are supplied by the hillslope aquifer.

abstract = {Hydrological modelling is a valuable tool for researchers in geography and other dis-ciplines for studying the processes governing impacts of climate change and urban development on water resources and for projecting potential ranges of impacts from scenarios of future change. Modelling is an inherently probabilistic exercise, with uncertainty amplifi ed at each stage of the process, from scenario generation to issues of scale, to simulation of hydrological processes, to man-agement impacts. At the basin scale, signifi cant factors affecting hydrological impacts of climate change include latitude, topography, geology, and land use. Under scenarios of future climate change, many basins are likely to experience changes not only in their mean hydrology, but also in the frequency and magnitude of extreme hydrological events. Impacts of climate change on water quality are largely determined by hydrological changes and by the nature of pollutants as fl ushing-or dilution-controlled. The most signifi cant impact of urban development on water resources is an increase in overall surface runoff and the fl ashiness of the storm hydrograph. The increase in impervious surface area associated with urban development also contributes to degradation of water quality as a result of non-point source pollution. Modelling studies on the combined impacts of climate change and urban development have found that either change may be more signifi cant, depending on scenario assumptions and basin characteristics, and that each type of change may amplify or ameliorate the effects of the other. Hydrological impacts of climate change and urban development are likely to signifi cantly affect future water resource management. I Introduction In a world in which the consensus view pre-dicts substantial impacts of anthropogenic climate change on global water resources in the near term and distant future (Kundzewicz et al., 2007), hydrological impact analysis has become a thriving area of research. Understanding potential climate-related im-at Stockholm University Library on February 3, 2016 ppg.sagepub.com Downloaded from Sarah Praskievicz and Heejun Chang: Basin-scale climate change 651 pacts is especially necessary given that these changes may interact in complex ways with other elements of global change (Clifford, 2009), notably urban development. These two driving forces of future hydrological change are likely to affect both water quan-tity and quality, at global, continental, re-gional, and basin scales, in geographically disparate areas around the world. Not only are changes in mean hydrology expected, but also changes in hydrological variability, which are particularly signifi cant for water resource management. Further complic-ating these issues is the inherent uncertainty present at every stage in the methods and techniques used by researchers to predict future changes. To improve understanding of processes involved and to project potential future conditions, hydrologists rely on models to simulate system behaviour. Large-scale and complex environmental systems such as the global hydrological cycle or basin pollutant loading cannot be investigated directly through experimentation, but instead must be generalized into their component pro-cesses. While modelling can be a powerful method for learning about and forecasting the system, it can be misused, and has a large amount of uncertainty associated with it. We begin this review by describing some issues related to modelling impacts of climate change on hydrology, namely sources of uncertainty, geographic factors infl uencing hydrological response to climate change, and hydrological variability. Next is an overview of research examining the impacts of climate change on water quality, and then impacts of urban development on hydrology. We then focus on empirical and modelling studies of the impacts of urban development on water quality. The subsequent section examines the combined modelling of climate change and urban development impacts on water quantity and quality, and we end by discussing implications of this research for adaptation in the water resources sector.

abstract = {Traditional conceptual models of landscape evolution view topography as an outcome of endogenic forces (uplift) working against exogenic forces of denudation. The energy considerations of these concepts have focused on the conversion of the potential energy of landscape relief to kinetic energy. The concept of the biosphere as a planetary membrane for capturing and converting solar energy, coupled with the critical geomorphic role of biota, call for a consideration of biotic contributions to geomorphic work. A review of estimates of global rates of kinetic energy of denudation and uplift, and net primary production (NPP) indicates that the energy density of NPP is, on average, three to seven orders of magnitude greater than the others. If even a tiny fraction of NPP is geologically significant, then the biological subsidy to the energy of landscape evolution must be considered on a par with that of geophysical and geochemical phenomena. A case study in eastern Kentucky shows that even if only 0.1 percent of NPP is geomorphically significant, it still far exceeds the energy inputs from uplift and conversion of potential to kinetic energy by denudation. This is unlikely to be unique, though the relative importance of biological and geophysical processes must obviously vary with climate, tectonic setting, and other factors. Results indicate that, particularly where biological activity is significant, geomorphic work performed by biota may be greater than that associated with endogenic processes and with the kinetic energy of denudation.},

abstract = {Mountaintop mining is the dominant form of coal mining and the largest driver of land cover change in the central Appalachians. The waste rock from these surface mines is disposed of in the adjacent river valleys, leading to a burial of headwater streams and dramatic increases in salinity and trace metal concentrations immediately downstream. In this synoptic study we document the cumulative impact of more than 100 mining discharge outlets and approximately 28 km(2) of active and reclaimed surface coal mines on the Upper Mud River of West Virginia. We measured the concentrations of major and trace elements within the tributaries and the mainstem and found that upstream of the mines water quality was equivalent to state reference sites. However, as eight separate mining-impacted tributaries contributed their flow, conductivity and the concentrations of selenium, sulfate, magnesium, and other inorganic solutes increased at a rate directly proportional to the upstream areal extent of mining. We found strong linear correlations between the concentrations of these contaminants in the river and the proportion of the contributing watershed in surface mines. All tributaries draining mountaintop-mining-impacted catchments were characterized by high conductivity and increased sulfate concentration, while concentrations of some solutes such as Se, Sr, and N were lower in the two tributaries draining reclaimed mines. Our results demonstrate the cumulative impact of multiple mines within a single catchment and provide evidence that mines reclaimed nearly two decades ago continue to contribute significantly to water quality degradation within this watershed.},

abstract = {Restoration of streams degraded by urbanization has usually been attempted by en- hancement of instream habitat or riparian zones. Such restoration approaches are unlikely to sub- stantially improve instream ecological condition because they do notmatch the scale of the degrading process. Recent studies of urban impacts on streams in Melbourne, Australia, on water chemistry, algal biomass and assemblage composition of diatoms and invertebrates, suggested that the primary degrading process to streams in many urban areas is effective imperviousness (EI), the proportion of a catchment covered by impervious surfaces directly connected to the stream by stormwater drain- age pipes. The direct connection of impervious surfaces to streams means that even small rainfall events can produce sufficient surface runoff to cause frequent disturbance through regular delivery of water and pollutants; where impervious surfaces are not directly connected to streams, small rainfall events are intercepted and infiltrated. We, therefore, identified use of alternative drainage methods, which maintain a near-natural frequency of surface runoff from the catchment, as the best approach to stream restoration in urban catchments and then used models of relationships between 14 ecological indicators and EI to determine restoration objectives. Ecological condition, as indicated by concentrations of water-quality variables, algal biomass, and several measures of diatom and macroinvertebrate assemblage composition, declined with increasing EI until a thresholdwas reached (EI ? 0.01–0.14), beyond which no further degradation was observed.We showed, in a sample catch- ment, that it is possible to redesign the drainage system to reduce EI to a level at which the models predict detectable improvement in most ecological indicators. Distributed, low-impact design mea- sures are required that intercept rainfall from small events and then facilitate its infiltration, evapo- ration, transpiration, or storage for later in-house use.},

abstract = {Conventional wisdom holds that the southern Appalachian Mountains have not experienced a significant phase of tectonic forcing for {\textgreater}200 myr; yet, they share many characteristics with tectonically active settings, including locally high topographic relief, steep slopes, incised river gorges, and frequent mass-wasting events. Two competing hypotheses are commonly used to explain their modern topographic expression. One suggests that relief is largely controlled by variable lithologic resistance to weathering and that their modern form has long persisted in a dynamic equilibrium. The second postulates that their relief is a product of recent rejuvenation, driven either by climate change or the epeirogenic uplift of the land surface driven by mantle forcing. Within portions of the Cullasaja River basin of the southern Appalachians, we show that relief has increased by {\textgreater}150{\%} since the Miocene. Evident within the basin are a set of retreating knickpoints that delineate a rugged, actively incising landscape from lower-relief relict topography. Constraints on the timing of knickpoint entry into the basin suggest that the process of landscape rejuvenation began well prior to the late Cenozoic ({\textless}4 myr) transition to a more oscillatory (glacial-interglacial) climate regime. Furthermore, the geomorphology of the Cullasaja River basin is difficult to reconcile in the context of a transition to a more erosive climatic regime but is consistent with an epeirogenically uplifted landscape. Consequently, these observations lend new support to the idea that the rugged topography of the southern Appalachians has developed in response to post-orogenic regional uplift in the Miocene.},

We used a high-resolution 130,000-year environmental record to help resolve the cause and reconstruct the ecological consequences of extinction of Australia's megafauna. Our results suggest that human arrival rather than climate caused megafaunal extinction, which then triggered replacement of mixed rainforest by sclerophyll vegetation through a combination of direct effects on vegetation of relaxed herbivore pressure and increased fire in the landscape. This ecosystem shift was as large as any effect of climate change over the last glacial cycle, and indicates the magnitude of changes that may have followed megafaunal extinction elsewhere in the world.},

abstract = {The factors determining species commonness and rarity are poorly understood, particularly in highly diverse communities. Theory predicts that interactions with neighbors of the same (conspecific) and other (heterospecific) species can influence a species' relative abundance, but empirical tests are lacking. By using a hierarchical model of survival for more than 30,000 seedlings of 180 tropical tree species on Barro Colorado Island, Panama, we tested whether species' sensitivity to neighboring individuals relates to their relative abundance in the community. We found wide variation among species in the effect of conspecific, but not heterospecific, neighbors on survival, and we found a significant relationship between the strength of conspecific neighbor effects and species abundance. Specifically, rare species suffered more from the presence of conspecific neighbors than common species did, suggesting that conspecific density dependence shapes species abundances in diverse communities.},

abstract = {Human appropriation of net primary production (HANPP), the aggregate impact of land use on biomass available each year in ecosystems, is a prominent measure of the human domination of the biosphere. We present a comprehensive assessment of global HANPP based on vegetation modeling, agricultural and forestry statistics, and geographical information systems data on land use, land cover, and soil degradation that localizes human impact on ecosystems. We found an aggregate global HANPP value of 15.6 Pg C/yr or 23.8{\%} of potential net primary productivity, of which 53{\%} was contributed by harvest, 40{\%} by land-use-induced productivity changes, and 7{\%} by human-induced fires. This is a remarkable impact on the biosphere caused by just one species. We present maps quantifying human-induced changes in trophic energy flows in ecosystems that illustrate spatial patterns in the human domination of ecosystems, thus emphasizing land use as a pervasive factor of global importance. Land use transforms earth's terrestrial surface, resulting in changes in biogeochemical cycles and in the ability of ecosystems to deliver services critical to human well being. The results suggest that large-scale schemes to substitute biomass for fossil fuels should be viewed cautiously because massive additional pressures on ecosystems might result from increased biomass harvest.},

abstract = {Anthropogenic pressures on the Earth System have reached a scale where abrupt global environmental change can no longer be excluded. We propose a new approach to global sustainability in which we define planetary boundaries within which we expect that humanity can operate safely. Transgressing one or more planetary boundaries may be deleterious or even catastrophic due to the risk of crossing thresholds that will trigger non-linear, abrupt environmental change within continental- to planetary-scale systems. We have identified nine planetary boundaries and, drawing upon current scientific understanding, we propose quantifications for seven of them. These seven are climate change (CO2 concentration in the atmosphere {\textless}350 ppm and/or a maximum change of +1 W m-2 in radiative forcing); ocean acidification (mean surface seawater saturation state with respect to aragonite ≥ 80{\%} of pre-industrial levels); stratospheric ozone ({\textless}5{\%} reduction in O3 concentration from pre-industrial level of 290 Dobson Units); biogeochemical nitrogen (N) cycle (limit industrial and agricultural fixation of N2 to 35 Tg N yr-1) and phosphorus (P) cycle (annual P inflow to oceans not to exceed 10 times the natural background weathering of P); global freshwater use ({\textless}4000 km3 yr-1 of consumptive use of runoff resources); land system change ({\textless}15{\%} of the ice-free land surface under cropland); and the rate at which biological diversity is lost (annual rate of {\textless}10 extinctions per million species). The two additional planetary boundaries for which we have not yet been able to determine a boundary level are chemical pollution and atmospheric aerosol loading. We estimate that humanity has already transgressed three planetary boundaries: for climate change, rate of biodiversity loss, and changes to the global nitrogen cycle. Planetary boundaries are interdependent, because transgressing one may both shift the position of other boundaries or cause them to be transgressed. The social impacts of transgressing boundaries will be a function of the social–ecological resilience of the affected societies. Our proposed boundaries are rough, first estimates only, surrounded by large uncertainties and knowledge gaps. Filling these gaps will require major advancements in Earth System and resilience science. The proposed concept of “planetary boundaries” lays the groundwork for shifting our approach to governance and management, away from the essentially sectoral analyses of limits to growth aimed at minimizing negative externalities, toward the estimation of the safe space for human development. Planetary boundaries define, as it were, the boundaries of the “planetary playing field” for humanity if we want to be sure of avoiding major human-induced environmental change on a global scale.},

However, the global extent of fire-driven discontinuities in tree cover is unknown, especially accounting for seasonality and soils. We use tree cover, climate, fire, and soils data sets to show that tree cover is globally discontinuous. Climate influences tree cover globally but, at intermediate rainfall (1000 to 2500 millimeters) with mild seasonality (less than 7 months), tree cover is bimodal, and only fire differentiates between savanna and forest. These may be alternative states over large areas, including parts of Amazonia and the Congo. Changes in biome distributions, whether at the cost of savanna (due to fragmentation) or forest (due to climate), will be neither smooth nor easily reversible.},

While the practice of river restoration has grown exponentially over the last several decades, there has been little empirical evaluation of whether restoration projects individually or cumulatively achieve the legally mandated goals of improving the structure and function of streams and rivers. New efforts to evaluate river restoration projects that use channel reconfiguration as a methodology for improving stream ecosystem structure and function are finding little evidence for measurable ecological improvement. While designed channels may have less-incised banks and greater sinuousity than the degraded streams they replace, these reach-scale efforts do not appear to be effectively mitigating the physical, hydrological, or chemical alterations that are responsible for the loss of sensitive taxa and the declines in water quality that typically motivate restoration efforts. Here we briefly summarize this new literature, including the collection of papers within this Invited Feature, and provide our perspective on the limitations of current restoration.},

Forested ecosystems are of particular interest because of the biodiversity they support and their diverse values to people. Developments in conservation, restoration forestry, and in the study of designer ecosystems provide a diverse set of tools with which to pursue sustainable forestry goals. Nonetheless, we suggest that sustainable forestry can only be achieved by fully considering ecological, economic, and social needs in landscapes. This will require a clear realization of the trade-offs in site-specific management approaches and a multifaceted, landscape-scale perspective for evaluation of sustainability criteria. We propose collaborative creation of Sustainable Forestry Portfolios as a means to encourage the breadth of thinking required to guide sustainable forest management. We discuss 3 examples of Sustainable Forestry Portfolios with relevance to different settings in the future: 1) the Triad Approach, 2) Forest Landscape Restoration, and 3) Urban Forestry. In all settings, sustainable forestry is not solely a technical problem, but a challenge that must be met through a multidimensional perspective, interdisciplinary collaboration, and with active engagement of the people that live and work in the landscape.},

Novel ecosystems (also termed 'emerging ecosystems') result when species occur in combinations and relative abundances that have not occurred previously within a given biome. Key characteristics are novelty, in the form of new species combinations and the potential for changes in ecosystem functioning, and human agency, in that these ecosystems are the result of deliberate or inadvertent human action. As more of the Earth becomes transformed by human actions, novel ecosystems increase in importance, but are relatively little studied. Either the degradation or invasion of native or 'wild' ecosystems or the abandonment of intensively managed systems can result in the formation of these novel systems. Important considerations are whether these new systems are persistent and what values they may have. It is likely that it may be very difficult or costly to return such systems to their previous state, and hence consideration needs to be given to developing appropriate management goals and approaches.},

Air particulate matter (PM) collected within one mile of active MTM site in Edwight, WV (PMMTM), consisting of silica (Si, 48{\%}) and molybdenum (Mo, 29{\%}) as major constituents, was used for cell exposure studies. As control, PM collected from the neighboring areas that do not have coal mining in Green Bank, WV (PMCON) was used. Chronic exposure (3 months) of non-tumorigenic human lung epithelial BEAS-2B cells to sub-cytotoxic concentration (1 $\mu$g/mL) of PMMTM, but not PMCON, was found to induce malignant transformation of the cells, as indicated by loss of contact inhibition and anchorage-independent cell growth. The PMMTM-transformed cells also induced tumor formation in vivo using a xenograft mouse model. Exposure to Mo (1 $\mu$g/mL), but not Si, similarly induced malignant transformation and tumorigenesis of the lung epithelial cells, suggesting that Mo may be a key contributing factor of PMMTM pathologic effects.},

Contrary to claims made in the media, peatland destroyed by open-pit mining will not be restored. Current plans dictate its replacement with upland forest and tailings storage lakes, amounting to the destruction of over 29,500 ha of peatland habitat. Landscape changes caused by currently approved mines will release between 11.4 and 47.3 million metric tons of stored carbon and will reduce carbon sequestration potential by 5,734-7,241 metric tons C/y. These losses have not previously been quantified, and should be included with the already high estimates of carbon emissions from oil sands mining and bitumen upgrading. A fair evaluation of the costs and benefits of oil sands mining requires a rigorous assessment of impacts on natural capital and ecosystem services.},

Resilience has been used as a framework for understanding sustainability challenges in a range of ecosystem types, but has not been systematically applied across the range of systems specifically used for the production of food and fiber in terrestrial, freshwater, and marine environments.

This paper describes morphologically similar stream reaches that are divided into 7 major stream type categories that differ in entrenchment, gradient, width/depth ratio, and sinuosity in various landforms. Within each major category are six additional types delineated by dominate channel materials from bedrock to silt/clay along a continuum of gradient ranges. Recent stream type data used to further define classification interrelationships were derived from 450 rivers throughout the U.S, Canada, and New Zealand. Data used in the development of this classification involved a great diversity of hydro-physiographic/geomorphic provinces from small to large rivers and in catchments from headwater streams in the mountains to the coastal plains. A stream hierarchical inventory system is presented which utilizes the stream classification system. Examples for use of this stream classification system for engineering, fish habitat enhancement, restoration and water resource management applications are presented. Specific examples of these applications include hydraulic geometry relations, sediment supply/availability, fish habitat structure evaluation, flow resistance, critical shear stress estimates, shear stress/velocity relations, streambank erodibility potential, management interpretations, sequences of morphological evolution, and river restoration principles.},

The relationship is also complex, because the concept of stability is multifaceted; different types of stability describing different properties of ecosystems lead to multiple diversity-stability relationships. A growing number of empirical studies demonstrate positive diversity-stability relationships. These studies, however, have emphasized only a few types of stability, and they rarely uncover the mechanisms responsible for stability. Because anthropogenic changes often affect stability and diversity simultaneously, diversity-stability relationships cannot be understood outside the context of the environmental drivers affecting both. This shifts attention away from diversity-stability relationships toward the multiple factors, including diversity, that dictate the stability of ecosystems.},

abstract = {Understanding functional relationships within ecological networks can help reveal keys to ecosystem stability or fragility. Revealing these relationships is complicated by the difficulties of isolating variables or performing experimental manipulations within a natural ecosystem, and thus inferences are often made by matching models to observational data. Such models, however, require assumptions-or detailed measurements-of parameters such as birth and death rate, encounter frequency, territorial exclusion, and predation success. Here, we evaluate the use of a Bayesian network inference algorithm, which can reveal ecological networks based upon species and habitat abundance alone. We test the algorithm's performance and applicability on observational data of avian communities and habitat in the Peak District National Park, United Kingdom. The resulting networks correctly reveal known relationships among habitat types and known interspecific relationships. In addition, the networks produced novel insights into ecosystem structure and identified key species with high connectivity. Thus, Bayesian networks show potential for becoming a valuable tool in ecosystem analysis.},

abstract = {As catchments become increasingly urban, the streams that drain them become increasingly degraded. Urban streams are typically characterized by high-magnitude storm flows, homogeneous habitats, disconnected riparian zones, and elevated nitrogen concentrations. To reverse the degradation of urban water quality, watershed managers and regulators are increasingly turning to stream restoration approaches. By reshaping the channel and reconnecting the surface waters with their riparian zone, practitioners intend to enhance the natural nutrient retention capacity of the restored stream ecosystem. Despite the exponential growth in stream restoration projects and expenditures, there has been no evaluation to date of the efficacy of urban stream restoration projects in enhancing nitrogen retention or in altering the underlying ecosystem metabolism that controls instream nitrogen consumption. In this study, we compared ecosystem metabolism and nitrate uptake kinetics in four stream restoration projects within urban watersheds to ecosystem functions measured in four unrestored urban stream segments and four streams draining minimally impacted forested watersheds in central North Carolina, U.S.A. All 12 sites were surveyed in June through August of 2006 and again in January through March of 2007. We anticipated that urban streams would have enhanced rates of ecosystem metabolism and nitrate uptake relative to forested streams due to the increases in nutrient loads and temperature associated with urbanization, and we predicted that restored streams would have further enhanced rates for these ecosystem functions by virtue of their increased habitat heterogeneity and water residence times. Contrary to our predictions we found that stream metabolism did not differ between stream types in either season and that nitrate uptake kinetics were not different between stream types in the winter. During the summer, restored stream reaches had substantially higher rates of nitrate uptake than unrestored or forested stream reaches; however, we found that variation in stream temperature and canopy cover explained 80{\%} of the variation across streams in nitrate uptake. Because the riparian trees are removed during the first stage of natural channel design projects, the restored streams in this study had significantly less canopy cover and higher summer temperatures than the urban and forested streams with which they were compared.},

Together, these examples illustrate the role of external forces in reshaping the systems in question and their vulnerability to environmental hazards, as well as the different capacities of stakeholders, based on their access to social and biophysical capital, to respond to the changes and hazards. The framework proves useful in directing attention to the interacting parts of the coupled system and helps identify gaps in information and understanding relevant to reducing vulnerability in the systems as a whole.},

abstract = {Ecological restoration is widely used to reverse the environmental degradation caused by human activities. However, the effectiveness of restoration actions in increasing provision of both biodiversity and ecosystem services has not been evaluated systematically. A meta-analysis of 89 restoration assessments in a wide range of ecosystem types across the globe indicates that ecological restoration increased provision of biodiversity and ecosystem services by 44 and 25{\%}, respectively. However, values of both remained lower in restored versus intact reference ecosystems. Increases in biodiversity and ecosystem service measures after restoration were positively correlated. Results indicate that restoration actions focused on enhancing biodiversity should support increased provision of ecosystem services, particularly in tropical terrestrial biomes.},

abstract = {Site assessment and monitoring data were analyzed for 26 stream restoration projects in North Carolina where the channel was reconfigured. Post-project changes in channel capacity were highly variable from site to site, but more than 60{\%} of the projects underwent, on average at a given site, at least a 20{\%} change in channel capacity. An analysis of site and basin geomorphology revealed that large post-construction adjustments were associated with highly dynamic stream channels characterized by a combination of high sediment transport capacity, large sediment supply, and/or easily eroded bank materials. In-stream structures along dynamic, reconfigured channels also exhibited high incidences of damage. Thus, the design and construction of channels in a state of equilibrium, which do not exhibit excessive erosion or deposition along highly dynamic rivers is currently problematic. In light of these findings, a conceptual framework based on geomorphic parameters is put forth to assess the likelihood of project success early in the design process to (1) eliminate high risk sites from consideration of channel reconfiguration and (2) improve upon the implemented management strategies that are ultimately used. It is also argued that where space permits an enhanced natural channel, adjustment approach is likely to be more effective than projects based on natural channel design.},

As practiced within this science, the two research themes appear to coalesce around one of the foundational pivots of sustainability, the coupled human-environment system. They differ in regard to their attention to two other pivots, environmental services and the tradeoffs of these services with human outcomes. In this essay I briefly review the emergence of sustainability science and the three foundational pivots relevant to vulnerability and resilience. I outline the distinctions and similarities between the two research themes foremost as practiced within sustainability science and especially in regard to the attention given to the three pivots. I conclude with the observation that improvement in the capacity of vulnerability and resilience research to inform sustainability science may hinge on their linkages in addressing tradeoffs. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{VanWilgen2011,
abstract = {This paper uses five inter-related topics (the management of rivers, fire regimes, invasive alien species, rare antelope and elephants) to assess 15. years of adaptive management in the Kruger National Park (KNP), South Africa. The importance of adaptive planning (a process for developing achievable objectives, which is adaptive because objectives are revised as understanding grows), has been highlighted by this assessment, and the KNP's track record of adaptive planning is better than that of adaptive management. Adaptive management has identified important issues with regard to biodiversity conservation, and resulted in a shift in management focus to these issues. Because the conservation outcomes of management shifts will only manifest themselves in the longer term, the relative success of adaptive management should be measured by the degree to which management has been refocused onto priority issues, and by the rate at which new understanding is generated. Some issues previously seen as important (fire, rare antelope), are now regarded as less so, while others remain important and difficult to solve, although there has been some progress (rivers, alien plants and elephants). It has also proved difficult to implement active adaptive management (large-scale, replicated trials using different approaches), because of local variation and logistical problems. Adaptive management will remain the approach of choice because there is some progress, and no known alternative to managing this complex ecosystem. It is simply not an option to return to the easily-understood " implementable" solutions (such as culling, regular prescribed burning, or artificial water provision) that demonstrably did not work. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Mountaintop coal mining (MCM) in the Southern Appalachian forest region greatly impacts both soil and aquatic ecosystems. Policy and practice currently in place emphasize water quality and soil stability but do not consider upland soil health. Here we report soil organic carbon (SOC) measurements and other soil quality indicators for reclaimed soils in the Southern Appalachian forest region to quantify the health of the soil ecosystem. The SOC sequestration rate of the MCM soils was 1.3 MgC ha(-1) yr(-1) and stocks ranged from 1.3 ± 0.9 to 20.9 ± 5.9 Mg ha(-1) and contained only 11{\%} of the SOC of surrounding forest soils. Comparable reclaimed mining soils reported in the literature that are supportive of soil ecosystem health had SOC stocks 2.5-5 times greater than the MCM soils and sequestration rates were also 1.6-3 times greater. The high compaction associated with reclamation in this region greatly reduces both the vegetative rooting depth and infiltration of the soil and increases surface runoff, thus bypassing the ability of soil to naturally filter groundwater. In the context of environmental sustainability of MCM, it is proposed that the entire watershed ecosystem be assessed and that a revision of current policy be conducted to reflect the health of both water and soil.},

abstract = {We compared forest canopy heights and nitrogen concentrations in long-term research sites and in 2 x 2 km landscapes surrounding these sites along a substrate age gradient in the Hawaiian Islands. Both remote airborne and ground-based measurements were used to characterize processes that control landscape-level variation in canopy properties. We integrated a waveform light detection and ranging (LiDAR) system, a high-resolution imaging spectrometer, and a global positioning system/inertial measurement unit to provide highly resolved images of ground topography, canopy heights, and canopy nitrogen concentrations (1) within a circle 50 m in radius focused on a long-term study site in the center of each landscape; (2) for the entire 2 x 2 km landscape regardless of land cover; and (3) after stratification, for our target cover class, native-dominated vegetation on constructional geomorphic surfaces throughout each landscape. Remote measurements at all scales yielded the same overall patterns as did ground-based measurements in the long-term sites. The two younger landscapes supported taller trees than did older landscapes, while the two intermediate-aged landscapes had higher canopy nitrogen (N) concentrations than did either young or old landscapes. However, aircraft-based analyses detected substantial variability in canopy characteristics on the landscape level, even within the target cover class. Canopy heights were more heterogeneous on the older landscapes, with coefficients of variation increasing from 23-41{\%} to 69-78{\%} with increasing substrate age. This increasing heterogeneity was associated with a larger patch size of canopy turnover and with dominance of most secondary successional stands by the mat-forming fern Dicranopteris linearis in the older landscapes.},

abstract = {Is it time to embrace the so-called “Anthropocene”—the age of human dominion—and to abandon tried-and-true conservation tools such as parks and wilderness areas? Is the future of Earth to be fully domesticated, an engineered global garden managed by technocrats to serve humanity? The schism between advocates of rewilding and those who accept and even celebrate a “post-wild” world is arguably the hottest intellectual battle in contemporary conservation. In Keeping the Wild, a group of prominent scientists, writers, and conservation activists responds to the Anthropocene-boosters who claim that wild nature is no more (or in any case not much worth caring about), that human-caused extinction is acceptable, and that “novel ecosystems” are an adequate replacement for natural landscapes. With rhetorical fists swinging, the book's contributors argue that these “new environmentalists” embody the hubris of the managerial mindset and offer a conservation strategy that will fail to protect life in all its buzzing, blossoming diversity. With essays from Eileen Crist, David Ehrenfeld, Dave Foreman, Lisi Krall, Harvey Locke, Curt Meine, Kathleen Dean Moore, Michael Soul{\'{e}}, Terry Tempest Williams and other leading thinkers, Keeping the Wild provides an introduction to this important debate, a critique of the Anthropocene boosters' attack on traditional conservation, and unapologetic advocacy for wild nature.},

abstract = {A trend of increasing streamflow has been observed in the Mississippi River (MR) basin since the 1940 s as a result of increased precipitation. Herein we show that increasing MR flow is mainly in its baseflow as a result of land use change and accompanying agricultural activities that occurred in the MR basin during the last 60 years. Agricultural land use change in the MR basin has affected the basin-scale hydrology: more precipitation is being routed into streams as baseflow than stormflow since 1940 s. We explain that the conversion of perennial vegetation to seasonal row crops, especially soybeans, in the basin since 1940 s may have reduced evapotranspiration, increased groundwater recharge, and thus increased baseflow and streamflow. This explanation is supported with a data analysis of the annually and monthly flow rates at various river stations in the MR basin. Results from this study will help to direct our effort in managing land use and in reducing nutrient levels in MR and other major rivers since nutrient concentrations and loads carried by storm water and baseflow are different. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {In this study we present a mathematical model for sediment entrainment, transport and deposition caused by the combined action of tidal currents and wind waves in shallow micro-tidal basins. The model uses a bi-granular mixture made up of cohesive and non-cohesive sediments thus considering clay, silt and sand, all of which commonly characterize the sediment bed composition of estuaries and tidal basins. The model also describes the evolution of bed elevation and evaluates the variation of bed sediment composition distinguishing cohesive from non-cohesive behavior.A stochastic approach is proposed to evaluate sediment entrainment close to incipient sediment motion. Particular attention is also given to the problem of reconstructing a reliable initial bed composition as this has a significant impact on sediment entrainment.The model was applied to the test case of the Venice lagoon (Italy) and good agreement was found when comparing model results to a series of turbidity measurements collected inside the lagoon. The model was then used to predict the actual net amount of sand and mud flowing through the inlets and the bottom evolution in terms of elevation and composition. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {One long-term vision for species could be that they persist in viable numbers in representative parts of their indigenous ranges in dynamic and resilient ecosystems over spatial and temporal scales that allow natural selection to take place. Most people would call such populations wild. But with the challenges that biodiversity faces from habitat loss and fragmentation, overuse, pollution and disease, and with threats acting synergistically, how many populations can we really call 'wild'? When does human intervention in the form of habitat manipulation or population support or control render a population no longer wild? Although wild may be instinctively interpreted as the opposite of tame or managed these states represent the ends of a continuum, and drawing a line between them is not straightforward. The need to define what is wild and non-wild is not just a theoretical issue but one that has practical implications for, inter alia, international agree-ments (Convention on Biological Diversity, CITES, Convention on Migratory Species), national legislation, lists of protected species and the IUCN Red List, all of which relate to wild species. None of these, however, provide a definition; for example, the current IUCN Red List guidelines state that the process should be applied to wild populations but without defining what constitutes 'wild' (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee, 2013). Redford et al. (2011) defined the spectrum of manage-ment support for securing threatened vertebrate popu-lations. They proposed five steps to cover the full range of level and type of human intervention in management (self-sustaining, conservation dependent, lightly managed, intensively managed and captive breeding) but did not explicitly distinguish within this typology between wild and non-wild. Interventions take many forms: habitat creation or manipulation, provision of supplementary food and salt licks, creation of artificial water points, provision of shelter (nest boxes for birds, bat boxes and roosts), predator control, population reinforcement, reintroduction, veter-inary measures, and fencing to keep species in or out of an area. Given the extent of human intervention in biodiversity conservation, excluding any management effort from consideration of what is wild is impractical as it would render many populations and species non-wild. The dividing line would appear most logically placed between lightly and intensively managed (sensu Redford et al., 2011) and the type of, and degree of dependence on, the management intervention assessed on a case-by case basis—resulting perhaps in a somewhat fuzzy line rather than a precise definition with universal applicability. Vultures in south and south-east Asia have been provided with clean carcases free of toxins, such as diclofenac, at vulture restaurants; are vultures in those areas mainly or wholly dependent on this food thereby non-wild? Are bird populations heavily dependent on winter food at garden bird tables wild? Does living in gardens and orchards count as being in the wild? Wherever the theoretical line between wild and non-wild is drawn, as the numbers and distributions of many species shrink and become more fragmented there is an undeniable trend for many of those remaining to receive increasing levels of management intervention and thus become less wild. Fragmentation as a result of anthropogenic activities is exacerbated by confinement within fenced areas to protect from overharvesting and encroachment, further hindering movement of individuals—and genetic exchange—between subpopulations. Most cheetahs and wild dogs in South Africa will be dependent in the long term on movement of individuals between small subpopulations in fenced areas. Management becomes more intensive (e.g. culling to control numbers) when the ecosystem remnants become so small they are no longer self-regulating: increasing rarity means more species need specific conservation interven-tions. Measures are intensified when rare species acquire great commercial value: thus rhinos increasingly need military-quality protection measures, with fenced sanctu-aries being developed both outside and inside African protected areas. Even if rhinos carry on their normal habits inside the fenced area, do these measures mean they are no longer wild? There is a parallel with changes in the concept of naturalness. Landscape scale intervention began when early humans used fire and tools to modify the habitats in which they lived, and developed further with the domestication of wild animals and cultivation of crops. As Pearce (2013) has shown, a fifth of the land across the world had been transformed by humans as early as 5,000 years ago—a proportion that past studies of historical land use had assumed was only reached in the past 100 years or so. Much primary tropical rain forest is now seen to be secondary DAVID P. MALLON 3 Acre Street,},

abstract = {The most important anthropogenic influences on climate are the emission of greenhouse gases1 and changes in land use, such as urbanization and agriculture2. But it has been difficult to separate these two influences because both tend to increase the daily mean surface temperature3, 4. The impact of urbanization has been estimated by comparing observations in cities with those in surrounding rural areas, but the results differ significantly depending on whether population data5 or satellite measurements of night light6, 7, 8 are used to classify urban and rural areas7, 8. Here we use the difference between trends in observed surface temperatures in the continental United States and the corresponding trends in a reconstruction of surface temperatures determined from a reanalysis of global weather over the past 50 years, which is insensitive to surface observations, to estimate the impact of land-use changes on surface warming. Our results suggest that half of the observed decrease in diurnal temperature range is due to urban and other land-use changes. Moreover, our estimate of 0.27 °C mean surface warming per century due to land-use changes is at least twice as high as previous estimates based on urbanization alone7, 8.},

abstract = {Contradictions between system-specific evidence and broader paradigms to explain ecosystem behavior present a challenge for natural resource management. In Florida (U.S.A.) springs, increasing nitrate (NO3-) concentrations have been implicated as the cause of algal overgrowth via alleviation of N-limitation. As such, policy and management efforts have centered heavily on reduction of nitrogen (N) loads. While the N-limitation hypothesis appears well founded on broadly supported aquatic eutrophication models, several observations from Florida springs are inconsistent with this hypothesis in its present simplified form. First, NO3- concentration is not correlated with algal abundance across the broad population of springs and is weakly negatively correlated with primary productivity. Second, within individual spring runs, algal mats are largely confined to the headwater reaches within 250 m of spring vents, while elevated NO3- concentrations persist for several kilometers or more. Third, historic observations suggest that establishment of macroalgal mats often lags behind observed increases in NO3- by more than a decade. Fourth, although microcosm experiments indicate high thresholds for N-limitation of algae, experiments in situ have demonstrated only minimal response to N enrichment. These muted responses may reflect large nutrient fluxes in springs, which were sufficient to satisfy present demand even at historic concentrations. New analyses of existing data indicate that dissolved oxygen (DO) has declined dramatically in many Florida springs over the past 30 years, and that DO and grazer abundance are better predictors of algal abundance in springs than are nutrient concentrations. Although a precautionary N-reduction strategy for Florida springs is warranted given demonstrable effects of nutrient enrichment in a broad suite of aquatic systems worldwide, the DO-grazer hypothesis and other potential mechanisms merit increased scientific scrutiny. This case study illustrates the importance of an adaptive approach that explicitly evaluates paradigms as hypotheses and actively seeks alternative explanations.},

As ecological restoration practitioners seek to protect and remediate urban ecosystems, I contend that the broad set of principles developed by the environmental justice movement can provide an excellent conceptual framework for integrating social ecologies into restoration plans. Successful integration is constrained, however, by a number of challenges both within the Principles of Environmental Justice and ecological restoration theory and practice. Using a case study of New York City's Green Guerillas community gardening program, I show how the principles can begin to be operationalized to provide an effective grounding methodology for the design, development, and implementation of urban restoration projects.

abstract = {A B S T R A C T Sea surface salinity (SSS) is an important parameter to characterize physical and biogeochemical processes, yet its remote estimation in coastal waters has been difficult because satellite sensors designed to " measure " SSS lack sufficient resolution and coverage, and higher-resolution ocean color measurements suffer from optical and biogeochemical complexity when used to estimate SSS. In the northern Gulf of Mexico (GOM), this challenge is addressed through modeling, validation, and extensive tests in contrasting environments. Specifically, using extensive SSS datasets collected by many groups spanning {\textgreater} 10 years and MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) and SeaWiFS (Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor) estimated remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) at 412, 443, 488 (490), 555, and 667 (670) nm and sea surface temperature (SST), a multilayer perceptron neural network-based (MPNN) SSS model has been developed and validated with a spatial resolution of {\~{}}1 km. The MPNN was selected over many other empirical approaches such as principle component analysis (PCA), multi-nonlinear regression (MNR), decision tree, random forest, and supporting vector machines (SVMs) after extensive evaluations. The MPNN was trained by a back-propagation learning technique with Levenberg-Marquardt optimization and Bayesian regularization. The model showed an overall performance of root mean square error (RMSE) = 1.2, with coefficient of determination (R 2) = 0.86, mean bias (MB) = 0.0, and mean ratio (MR) = 1.0 for SSS ranging between {\~{}}1 and {\~{}}37 (N = 3640). Validation using an independent dataset showed a RMSE of 1.1, MB of 0.0, and MR of 1.0 for SSS ranging between {\~{}}27 and {\~{}}37 (N = 412). The model with its original parameterization has been tested in the Mississippi-Atchafalaya coastal region, Florida's Big Bend region, and in the offshore Mississippi River plume, with satisfactory performance obtained in each case. Comparison with concurrent Aquarius-derived SSS maps (110-km resolution) showed similar agreement in offshore waters as indicated above, but the new 1-km resolution SSS maps revealed more finer-scale features as well as salinity gradients in coastal waters. The sensitivity of the model to realistic model input errors in satellite-derived SST and Rrs was also thoroughly examined, with uncertainties in the model-derived SSS being al-ways {\textless} 1 for SSS {\textgreater} 30. The extensive validation, evaluation, and sensitivity test all indicated the robustness of the MPNN model in estimating SSS in most, if not all, coastal waters and offshore plumes in the northern GOM. Thus, the model provided a basis for generating near real-time 1-km resolution SSS maps from satellite mea-surements. However, the model showed limitations when applied to regions with known algal blooms or up-welling as they both led to low Rrs in the blue bands that may be falsely recognized as caused by low SSS.},

abstract = {Automated cloud and cloud shadow identification algorithms designed for Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) satellite images have greatly expanded the use of these Earth observation data by providing a means of including only clear-view pixels in image analysis and efficient cloud-free compositing. In an effort to extend these capabilities to Landsat Multispectal Scanner (MSS) imagery, we introduce MSS clear-view-mask (MSScvm), an automated cloud and shadow identification algorithm for MSS imagery. The algorithm is specific to the unique spectral characteristics of MSS data, relying on a simple, rule-based approach. Clouds are identified based on green band brightness and the normalized difference between the green and red bands, while cloud shadows are identified by near infrared band darkness and cloud projection. A digital elevation model is incorporated to correct for topography-induced illumination variation and aid in identifying water. Based on an accuracy assessment of 1981 points stratified by land cover and algorithm mask class for 12 images throughout the United States, MSScvm achieved an overall accuracy of 84.0{\%}. Omission of thin clouds and bright cloud shadows constituted much of the error. Perennial ice and snow, misidentified as cloud, also contributed disproportionally to algorithm error. Comparison against a corresponding assessment of the Fmask algorithm, applied to coincident TM imagery, showed similar error patterns and a general reduction in accuracy commensurate with differences in the radiometric and spectral richness of the two sensors. MSScvm provides a suitable automated method for creating cloud and cloud shadow masks for MSS imagery required for time series analyses in temperate ecosystems.},

abstract = {Despite decades of research on the ecological consequences of stream network expansion, contraction and fragmentation, surprisingly little is known about the hydrological mechanisms that shape these processes. Here, we present field surveys of the active drainage networks of four California headwater streams (4–27km2) spanning diverse topographic, geologic and climatic settings. We show that these stream networks dynamically expand, contract, disconnect and reconnect across all the sites we studied. Stream networks at all four sites contract and disconnect during seasonal flow recessions, with their total active network length, and thus their active drainage densities, decreasing by factors of two to three across the range of flows captured in our field surveys. The total flowing lengths of the active stream networks are approximate power-law functions of unit discharge, with scaling exponents averaging 0.27± 0.04 (range: 0.18–0.40). The number of points where surface flow originates obey similar power-law relationships, as do the lengths and origination points of flowing networks that are continuously connected to the outlet, with scaling exponents averaging 0.36–0.48. Even stream order shifts seasonally by up to two Strahler orders in our study catchments. Broadly, similar stream length scaling has been observed in catchments spanning widely varying geologic, topographic and climatic settings and spanning more than two orders of magnitude in size, suggesting that network extension/contraction is a general phenomenon that may have a general explanation. Points of emergence or disappearance of surface flow represent the balance between subsurface transmissivity in the hyporheic zone and the delivery of water from upstream. Thus the dynamics of stream network expansion and contraction, and connection and disconnection, may offer important clues to the spatial structure of the hyporheic zone, and to patterns and processes of runoff generation.},

abstract = {1. A fundamental goal of ecological network research is to understand how the complexity observed in nature can persist and how this affects ecosystem functioning. This is essential for us to be able to predict, and eventually mitigate, the consequences of increasing environmental perturbations such as habitat loss, climate change, and invasions of exotic species. 2. Ecological networks can be subdivided into three broad types: 'traditional' food webs, mutualistic networks and host-parasitoid networks. There is a recent trend towards cross-comparisons among network types and also to take a more mechanistic, as opposed to phenomenological, perspective. For example, analysis of network configurations, such as compartments, allows us to explore the role of co-evolution in structuring mutualistic networks and host-parasitoid networks, and of body size in food webs. 3. Research into ecological networks has recently undergone a renaissance, leading to the production of a new catalogue of evermore complete, taxonomically resolved, and quantitative data. Novel topological patterns have been unearthed and it is increasingly evident that it is the distribution of interaction strengths and the configuration of complexity, rather than just its magnitude, that governs network stability and structure. 4. Another significant advance is the growing recognition of the importance of individual traits and behaviour: interactions, after all, occur between individuals. The new generation of high-quality networks is now enabling us to move away from describing networks based on species-averaged data and to start exploring patterns based on individuals. Such refinements will enable us to address more general ecological questions relating to foraging theory and the recent metabolic theory of ecology. 5. We conclude by suggesting a number of 'dead ends' and 'fruitful avenues' for future research into ecological networks.},

abstract = {The last 3.85 Gyr of Earth history have been divided into five stages. During stage 1 (3.85-2.45 Gyr ago (Ga)) the atmosphere was largely or entirely anoxic, as were the oceans, with the possible exception of oxygen oases in the shallow oceans. During stage 2 (2.45-1.85 Ga) atmospheric oxygen levels rose to values estimated to have been between 0.02 and 0.04 atm. The shallow oceans became mildly oxygenated, while the deep oceans continued anoxic. Stage 3 (1.85-0.85 Ga) was apparently rather 'boring'. Atmospheric oxygen levels did not change significantly. Most of the surface oceans were mildly oxygenated, as were the deep oceans. Stage 4 (0.85-0.54 Ga) saw a rise in atmospheric oxygen to values not much less than 0.2 atm. The shallow oceans followed suit, but the deep oceans were anoxic, at least during the intense Neoproterozoic ice ages. Atmospheric oxygen levels during stage 5 (0.54 Ga-present) probably rose to a maximum value of ca 0.3 atm during the Carboniferous before returning to its present value. The shallow oceans were oxygenated, while the oxygenation of the deep oceans fluctuated considerably, perhaps on rather geologically short time-scales.},

abstract = {Soil quality research has focused on intensively managed agricultural and forest soils, but the concept and importance of soil quality is also pertinent to reclaimed mine soils and other disturbed ecosystems. Adding organic amendments has been used as a means for ameliorating mine soils and improving their quality, but the long-term effects of amendments on soil quality are not known. In 1982, a mined site was amended with seven different surface treatments: a control (nothing added), 30 cm of native soil, 112 Mg ha -1 sawdust, and municipal sewage sludge (SS) at rates of 22, 56, 112, and 224 Mg ha -1. Four replicates of each treatment were installed as a randomized complete block design. Each plot was split and planted with pitch x loblolly pine hybrid (Pinus rigida x taeda) trees and Kentucky-31 tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.). During the 16-yr period, organic matter content, total organic N, N mineralization potential, aggregate stability, and other physical and chemical properties were measured as mine soil quality indicators. The comparative ability of these organic amendments to positively affect organic matter content, total N, and other parameters was most apparent and pronounced after 5 yr. However, after 16 yr, soil organic matter (SOM) content and total N appeared to be equilibrating at ≈10 000 and 750 kg ha -1, respectively. Organic matter inputs by vegetation alone across the 16-yr period in the control plots resulted in organic matter and N mineralization potential values comparable to levels in the organically-amended plots, indicating the overriding importance of vegetation in the soil recovery process. After 16 yr, there appears to be no lasting soil quality improvements due to addition of organic amendments to this mine soil. Amendments improved short-term production, but their cost of transport and application may be difficult to justify based on long-term soil quality improvement.},

WTC dust penetrated into indoor spaces, and public health concerns remain regarding exposure to possible residual dust in the affected areas. The goal of the studies outlined in this review was to determine which, if any, components of the bulk WTC dust are sufficiently above typical background dust levels in New York City to develop an analytical method to screen for the component(s). Components of the {\textless}150-microm-size fraction of the dust are gypsum, phases compatible with crushed concrete, man-made vitreous fibers (MMVFs), silica, lead, chrysotile asbestos, and other materials. Slag wool was the most common WTC MMVF, whereas soda-lime glass and rock wool were minor to trace constituents. Most background samples also contained gypsum, phases compatible with concrete, and MMVF. However, the proportions of the various MMVF in background samples are typically unlike those characteristic of bulk WTC dust. Results indicate that slag wool can be used as a signature marker to identify areas that contain potential residual WTC dust contamination at concentrations that are less than average background levels for the material.},

@article{Lerman2007,
abstract = {Consumption of CO2 in mineral weathering reactions is one of the major fluxes in the global carbon cycle that drives the weathering and transport of its products by surface water from land to the ocean. In the weathering cycle, carbon dioxide, as an acid derived directly from the atmosphere and(or) remineralization of organic matter in soil, is supplemented by small, but perhaps regionally important, amounts of sulfuric acid forming in the oxidation of pyrite (FeS2). Reactions of dissolved CO2 and H2SO4 with carbonate and silicate minerals in continental sediments and crystalline crust produce the bicarbonate ion HCO3- and release metal cations, such as the four major cationic components of river water, Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, and K+, and dissolved silica to solution. Depending on the reactions that may either only consume CO2 or uncommonly also produce it, a general relationship describing the CO2 consumption by weathering reactions with carbonate and silicate minerals is a weathering potential $\psi$ = (net CO2 consumed) / (HCO3- produced). The lower values of this ratio, about 0.54, are for carbonate rocks and evaporites, about 0.75 for shales and sandstones, and 1 for the crystalline igneous continental crust. In an average world river (of which there is more than one estimate of chemical composition), the mass proportions of the main cations and anions differ from those in the weathering source that consists of the sediments and part of the continental crust because of the differences in mineral solubilities and dissolution rates. A dissolution model of a weathering source that consists of 63 wt{\%} average sediment and 37 wt{\%} upper continental crust gives the concentrations of the major dissolved constituents in an average river that agree very well with the range of composition given by other investigators. This dissolution model also provides an average CO2 consumption potential of $\psi$ = 0.72 and a sequence of relative stability or order of persistence in the weathering of the mineral constituents of the sedimentary carbonate, silicate, and evaporitic rocks, and the crustal silicates. The CO2 consumption rate translates into a weathering flux of about 22 × 1012 mol C/yr, derived mainly from soil-atmosphere CO2 that forms by decomposition of organic matter in soils. Anthropogenic emissions of SO2 to the atmosphere, as projected for the future and at the upper bound of the projection, may provide H2SO4 to the continental surface that is 3 to 5 times greater than the natural H2SO4 production by the oxidation of pyrite in sediments. The higher input rates of H2SO4 may increase the dissolved ionic solid concentrations in river waters by about 13{\%}, without significantly affecting the CO2 consumption in weathering. In the global carbon cycle, the CO2 uptake in weathering is comparable to other interreservoir fluxes in the atmosphere-land-ocean system. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Maintaining connectivity for broad-scale ecological processes like dispersal and gene flow is essential for conserving endangered species in fragmented landscapes. However, determining which habitats should be set aside to promote connectivity has been difficult because existing models cannot incorporate effects of multiple pathways linking populations. Here, we test an ecological connectivity model that overcomes this obstacle by borrowing from electrical circuit theory. The model vastly improves gene flow predictions because it simultaneously integrates all possible pathways connecting populations. When applied to data from threatened mammal and tree species, the model consistently outperformed conventional gene flow models, revealing that barriers were less important in structuring populations than previously thought. Circuit theory now provides the best-justified method to bridge landscape and genetic data, and holds much promise in ecology, evolution, and conservation planning.},

abstract = {Transfers of treated water among inter-connected utilities is becoming more common as the cost of developing new supplies grows, and transfer agreements require well developed rules describing when and how much water will be transferred. The nature of the decision rules governing an agreement must also be coordinated with respect to the treatment and conveyance capacity required to execute the transfers. This study explores different combinations of infrastructure and agreement type that define three different transfer programs, describing the frequency and volume of transfers associated with each, as well as their costs. The agreements are described in terms of the type of decision rule employed: Take-or-Pay, where the timing and quantity of transfers is fixed; Days of Supply Remaining (DSR), which uses a static hydrologic indicator to trigger transfers; and Risk-of-Failure, a probability-based decision rule that involves consideration of both supply and demand. This analysis is conducted within the context of the Research Triangle area of North Carolina (USA), a rapidly growing area that is beginning to approach the practical limits of water resource development. The Risk-of-Failure agreement is shown to reduce the average volume of transfers by over 80{\%} compared to a Take-or-Pay agreement and by roughly half relative to the DSR agreement, leading to significant cost reductions. A utility's willingness to accept something less than guaranteed access to a specified quantity of water (i.e. an interruption) also has a significant impact on cost. Interruptions do not necessarily lead to lower reliability, but rather to the purchasing utility acquiring more water during off-peak periods when the seller has excess treatment capacity available. The lowest cost guaranteed agreement is 40-50{\%} more expensive than the lowest cost interruptible contract.},

abstract = {Permafrost soils in boreal and Arctic ecosystems store almost twice as much carbon as is currently present in the atmosphere. Permafrost thaw and the microbial decomposition of previously frozen organic carbon is considered one of the most likely positive climate feedbacks from terrestrial ecosystems to the atmosphere in a warmer world. The rate of carbon release from permafrost soils is highly uncertain, but it is crucial for predicting the strength and timing of this carbon-cycle feedback effect, and thus how important permafrost thaw will be for climate change this century and beyond. Sustained transfers of carbon to the atmosphere that could cause a significant positive feedback to climate change must come from old carbon, which forms the bulk of the permafrost carbon pool that accumulated over thousands of years. Here we measure net ecosystem carbon exchange and the radiocarbon age of ecosystem respiration in a tundra landscape undergoing permafrost thaw to determine the influence of old carbon loss on ecosystem carbon balance. We find that areas that thawed over the past 15 years had 40 per cent more annual losses of old carbon than minimally thawed areas, but had overall net ecosystem carbon uptake as increased plant growth offset these losses. In contrast, areas that thawed decades earlier lost even more old carbon, a 78 per cent increase over minimally thawed areas; this old carbon loss contributed to overall net ecosystem carbon release despite increased plant growth. Our data document significant losses of soil carbon with permafrost thaw that, over decadal timescales, overwhelms increased plant carbon uptake at rates that could make permafrost a large biospheric carbon source in a warmer world.},

N(2)O was produced and subsequently consumed at pH 4 in unsupplemented anoxic microcosms with cryoturbated but not in those with unturbated peat soil. Nitrate, nitrite and acetylene stimulated net N(2)O production of both soils in anoxic microcosms, indicating denitrification as the source of N(2)O. Up to 500 and 10 $\mu$M nitrate stimulated denitrification in cryoturbated and unturbated peat soils, respectively. Apparent maximal reaction velocities of nitrite-dependent denitrification were 28 and 18 nmol N(2)O g(DW)(-1) h(-1), for cryoturbated and unturbated peat soils, respectively. Barcoded amplicon pyrosequencing of narG, nirK/nirS and nosZ (encoding nitrate, nitrite and N(2)O reductases, respectively) yielded ≈49 000 quality-filtered sequences with an average sequence length of 444 bp. Up to 19 species-level operational taxonomic units were detected per soil and gene, many of which were distantly related to cultured denitrifiers or environmental sequences. Denitrification-associated gene diversity in cryoturbated and in unturbated peat soils differed. Quantitative PCR (inhibition-corrected per DNA extract) revealed higher copy numbers of narG in cryoturbated than in unturbated peat soil. Copy numbers of nirS were up to 1000 × higher than those of nirK in both soils, and nirS nirK(-1) copy number ratios in cryoturbated and unturbated peat soils differed. The collective data indicate that the contrasting N(2)O emission patterns of cryoturbated and unturbated peat soils are associated with contrasting denitrifier communities.},

abstract = {The processes controlling the carbon flux and carbon storage of the atmosphere, ocean and terrestrial biosphere are temperature sensitive and are likely to provide a positive feedback leading to amplified anthropogenic warming. Owing to this feedback, at timescales ranging from interannual to the 20-100-kyr cycles of Earth's orbital variations, warming of the climate system causes a net release of CO(2) into the atmosphere; this in turn amplifies warming. But the magnitude of the climate sensitivity of the global carbon cycle (termed gamma), and thus of its positive feedback strength, is under debate, giving rise to large uncertainties in global warming projections. Here we quantify the median gamma as 7.7 p.p.m.v. CO(2) per degrees C warming, with a likely range of 1.7-21.4 p.p.m.v. CO(2) per degrees C. Sensitivity experiments exclude significant influence of pre-industrial land-use change on these estimates. Our results, based on the coupling of a probabilistic approach with an ensemble of proxy-based temperature reconstructions and pre-industrial CO(2) data from three ice cores, provide robust constraints for gamma on the policy-relevant multi-decadal to centennial timescales. By using an ensemble of {\textgreater}200,000 members, quantification of gamma is not only improved, but also likelihoods can be assigned, thereby providing a benchmark for future model simulations. Although uncertainties do not at present allow exclusion of gamma calculated from any of ten coupled carbon-climate models, we find that gamma is about twice as likely to fall in the lowermost than in the uppermost quartile of their range. Our results are incompatibly lower (P {\textless} 0.05) than recent pre-industrial empirical estimates of approximately 40 p.p.m.v. CO(2) per degrees C (refs 6, 7), and correspondingly suggest approximately 80{\%} less potential amplification of ongoing global warming.},

However, this form of expansion is rarely taken into account in the way that urbanization is classically assessed in ecological studies. An explicit consideration of the temporal dynamics, although frequently missing, is crucial in order to understand the effects of urbanization on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in rapidly urbanizing landscapes. In particular, a temporal perspective highlights the importance of land-use legacies and transient dynamics in the response of biodiversity to environmental change. Here, we outline the essential elements of an emerging framework for urban ecology that incorporates the characteristics of contemporary urbanization and thus empowers ecologists to understand and intervene in the planning and management of cities.},

abstract = {For over a decade, the contribution of oil sands mining and processing to the pollution of the Athabasca River has been controversial. We show that the oil sands development is a greater source of contamination than previously realized. In 2008, within 50 km of oil sands upgrading facilities, the loading to the snowpack of airborne particulates was 11,400 T over 4 months and included 391 kg of polycyclic aromatic compounds (PAC), equivalent to 600 T of bitumen, while 168 kg of dissolved PAC was also deposited. Dissolved PAC concentrations in tributaries to the Athabasca increased from 0.009 microg/L upstream of oil sands development to 0.023 microg/L in winter and to 0.202 microg/L in summer downstream. In the Athabasca, dissolved PAC concentrations were mostly {\textless}0.025 microg/L in winter and 0.030 microg/L in summer, except near oil sands upgrading facilities and tailings ponds in winter (0.031-0.083 microg/L) and downstream of new development in summer (0.063-0.135 microg/L). In the Athabasca and its tributaries, development within the past 2 years was related to elevated dissolved PAC concentrations that were likely toxic to fish embryos. In melted snow, dissolved PAC concentrations were up to 4.8 microg/L, thus, spring snowmelt and washout during rain events are important unknowns. These results indicate that major changes are needed to the way that environmental impacts of oil sands development are monitored and managed.},

The review concentrates on experiences of adaptive governance of social-ecological systems during periods of abrupt change (crisis) and investigates social sources of renewal and reorganization. Such governance connects individuals, organizations, agencies, and institutions at multiple organizational levels. Key persons provide leadership, trust, vision, meaning, and they help transform management organizations toward a learning environment. Adaptive governance systems often self-organize as social networks with teams and actor groups that draw on various knowledge systems and experiences for the development of a common understanding and policies. The emergence of “bridging organizations” seem to lower the costs of collaboration and conflict resolution, and enabling legislation and governmental policies can support self-organization while framing creativity for adaptive comanagement efforts.

abstract = {Landscapes are shaped by the uplift, deformation and breakdown of bedrock and the erosion, transport and deposition of sediment. Life is important in all of these processes. Over short timescales, the impact of life is quite apparent: rock weathering, soil formation and erosion, slope stability and river dynamics are directly influenced by biotic processes that mediate chemical reactions, dilate soil, disrupt the ground surface and add strength with a weave of roots. Over geologic time, biotic effects are less obvious but equally important: biota affect climate, and climatic conditions dictate the mechanisms and rates of erosion that control topographic evolution. Apart from the obvious influence of humans, does the resulting landscape bear an unmistakable stamp of life? The influence of life on topography is a topic that has remained largely unexplored. Erosion laws that explicitly include biotic effects are needed to explore how intrinsically small-scale biotic processes can influence the form of entire landscapes, and to determine whether these processes create a distinctive topography.},

Meta-analysis was used to quantitatively assess invasive plant performance and release from enemy damage and how these change with residence time and geographic distribution. Invasive plants were compared either in their introduced and home ranges or with native congeners in the introduced range. Invasive plants in the introduced range were generally larger, allocated more to reproduction, and had lower levels of herbivore damage compared with conspecifics in the home range; pathogen attack, however, varied widely. In congener comparisons, invasive and native plants did not differ in size or herbivory, but invaders did allocate less to reproduction and had lower levels of pathogen damage. Time since introduction was a significant nonlinear predictor of enemy release for both herbivores and pathogens, with initial release in recently arrived species and little to no release after 50 to 200 years. Geographic distribution was also a significant nonlinear predictor of enemy release. The observed nonlinear relationships are consistent with dynamic invasions and may define targets for eradication efforts if these patterns hold up for individual species.},

abstract = {Market-based environmental regulations (e.g., cap and trade, "payments for ecosystem services") are increasingly common. However, few detailed studies of operating ecosystem markets have lent understanding to how such policies affect incentive structures for improving environmental quality. The largest U.S. market stems from the Clean Water Act provisions requiring ecosystem restoration to offset aquatic ecosystems damaged during development. We describe and test how variations in the rules governing this ecosystem market shift risk between regulators and entrepreneurs to promote ecological restoration. We analyze extensive national scale data to assess how two critical aspects of market structure - (a) the geographic scale of markets and (b) policies dictating the release of credits - affect the willingness of entrepreneurs to enter specific markets and produce credits. We find no discernible relationship between policies attempting to ease market entry and either the number of individual producers or total credits produced. Rather, market entry is primarily related to regional geography (the prevalence of aquatic ecosystems) and regional economic growth. Any improvements to policies governing ecosystem markets require explicit evaluation of the interplay between policy and risk elements affecting both regulators and entrepreneurial credit providers. Our findings extend to emerging, regulated ecosystem markets, including proposed carbon offset mechanisms, biodiversity banking, and water quality trading programs.},

abstract = {Surface mining is a common method for extracting coal in the coal fields of eastern Kentucky. Using the Forestry Reclamation Approach (FRA), which emphasizes the use of minimally compacted or loose-dumped spoil as a growth medium for trees, reclamation practitioners are successfully reestablishing forests. Yet, questions remain regarding the effects FRA has on the quality of waters discharged to receiving streams. To examine the effect of FRA on water quality, this study compared waters that were discharged from three types of spoils: predominantly brown, weathered sandstone (BROWN); predominantly gray, unweathered sandstone (GRAY); and an equal mixture of both aforementioned sandstones and shale (MIXED). The water quality parameters pH, EC, Ca, K, Mg, Na, NO-N, NH-N, SO, Cl, TC, suspended sediment concentration (SSC), settleable solids (SS), and turbidity were monitored over a 2-yr period on six 0.4-ha plots (two replications per spoil type). Generally, levels of Cl, SO, Ca, NO-N, NH-N, SS, SSC, and turbidity decreased over time. The pH for all spoils increased from about 7.5 to 8.5. The EC remained relatively level in the BROWN spoil, whereas the GRAY and MIXED spoils had downward trajectories that were approaching 500 $\mu$S cm. The value of 500 $\mu$S cm has been reported as the apparent threshold at which certain taxa such as Ephemeroptera (e.g., Mayfly) recolonize disturbed headwater streams of eastern Kentucky and adjacent coal-producing Appalachian states.},

abstract = {Two decades of scientific ocean drilling have demonstrated widespread microbial life in deep sub-seafloor sediment, and surprisingly high microbial-cell numbers. Despite the ubiquity of life in the deep biosphere, the large community sizes and the low energy fluxes in this vast buried ecosystem are not yet understood. It is not known whether organisms of the deep biosphere are specifically adapted to extremely low energy fluxes or whether most of the observed cells are in a dormant, spore-like state. Here we apply a new approach--the D:L-amino-acid model--to quantify the distributions and turnover times of living microbial biomass, endospores and microbial necromass, as well as to determine their role in the sub-seafloor carbon budget. The approach combines sensitive analyses of unique bacterial markers (muramic acid and D-amino acids) and the bacterial endospore marker, dipicolinic acid, with racemization dynamics of stereo-isomeric amino acids. Endospores are as abundant as vegetative cells and microbial activity is extremely low, leading to microbial biomass turnover times of hundreds to thousands of years. We infer from model calculations that biomass production is sustained by organic carbon deposited from the surface photosynthetic world millions of years ago and that microbial necromass is recycled over timescales of hundreds of thousands of years.},

However, little is known about the long-term dynamics of invasions; do invaders maintain their dominant status over long time spans, or do new ecological and evolutionary forces eventually develop to limit their populations? Alliaria petiolata is a Eurasian species that aggressively invades North American forest understories, in part due to the production of toxic phytochemicals. Here we document a marked decline in its phytotoxin production and a consequent decline in their impact on three native species, across a 50+ year chronosequence of Alliaria petiolata invasion. Genetic evidence suggests that these patterns result from natural selection for decreased phytotoxin production rather than founder effects during introduction and spread. These patterns are consistent with the finding of slowing A. petiolata population growth and rebounding native species abundance across a separate chronosequence in Illinois, U.S. These results suggest that this invader is developing evolutionary limits in its introduced range and highlight the importance of understanding the long-term processes that shape species invasions and their impacts.},

abstract = {Recent studies have documented adverse effects to biological communities downstream of mountaintop coal mining and valley fills (VF), but few data exist on the longevity of these impacts. We sampled 15 headwater streams with VFs reclaimed 11-33 years prior to 2011 and sampled seven local reference sites that had no VFs. We collected chemical, habitat, and benthic macroinvertebrate data in April 2011; additional chemical samples were collected in September 2011. To assess ecological condition, we compared VF and reference abiotic and biotic data using: (1) ordination to detect multivariate differences, (2) benthic indices (a multimetric index and an observed/expected predictive model) calibrated to state reference conditions to detect impairment, and (3) correlation and regression analysis to detect relationships between biotic and abiotic data. Although VF sites had good instream habitat, nearly 90 {\%} of these streams exhibited biological impairment. VF sites with higher index scores were co-located near unaffected tributaries; we suggest that these tributaries were sources of sensitive taxa as drifting colonists. There were clear losses of expected taxa across most VF sites and two functional feeding groups ({\%} scrapers and {\%}shredders) were significantly altered. Percent VF and forested area were related to biological quality but varied more than individual ions and specific conductance. Within the subset of VF sites, other descriptors (e.g., VF age, site distance from VF, the presence of impoundments, {\%} forest) had no detectable relationships with biological condition. Although these VFs were constructed pursuant to permits and regulatory programs that have as their stated goals that (1) mined land be reclaimed and restored to its original use or a use of higher value, and (2) mining does not cause or contribute to violations of water quality standards, we found sustained ecological damage in headwaters streams draining VFs long after reclamation was completed.},

abstract = {Accurately quantifying total freshwater storage methane release to atmosphere requires the spatial-temporal measurement of both diffusive and ebullitive emissions. Existing floating chamber techniques provide localised assessment of methane flux, however, significant errors can arise when weighting and extrapolation to the entire storage, particularly when ebullition is significant. An improved technique has been developed that compliments traditional chamber based experiments to quantify the storage-scale release of methane gas to atmosphere through ebullition using the measurements from an Optical Methane Detector (OMD) and a robotic boat. This provides a conservative estimate of the methane emission rate from ebullition along with the bubble volume distribution. It also georeferences the area of ebullition activity across entire storages at short temporal scales. An assessment on Little Nerang Dam in Queensland, Australia, demonstrated whole storage methane release significantly differed spatially and throughout the day. Total methane emission estimates showed a potential 32-fold variation in whole-of-dam rates depending on the measurement and extrapolation method and time of day used. The combined chamber and OMD technique showed that 1.8-7.0{\%} of the surface area of Little Nerang Dam is accounting for up to 97{\%} of total methane release to atmosphere throughout the day. Additionally, over 95{\%} of detectable ebullition occurred in depths less than 12 m during the day and 6 m at night. This difference in spatial and temporal methane release rate distribution highlights the need to monitor significant regions of, if not the entire, water storage in order to provide an accurate estimate of ebullition rates and their contribution to annual methane emissions. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Biodiversity loss is widely recognized as a serious global environmental change process. While large-scale metal mining activities do not belong to the top drivers of such change, these operations exert or may intensify pressures on biodiversity by adversely changing habitats, directly and indirectly, at local and regional scales. So far, analyses of global spatial dynamics of mining and its burden on biodiversity focused on the overlap between mines and protected areas or areas of high value for conservation. However, it is less clear how operating metal mines are globally exerting pressure on zones of different biodiversity richness; a similar gap exists for unmined but known mineral deposits. By using vascular plants' diversity as a proxy to quantify overall biodiversity, this study provides a first examination of the global spatial distribution of mines and deposits for five key metals across different biodiversity zones. The results indicate that mines and deposits are not randomly distributed, but concentrated within intermediate and high diversity zones, especially bauxite and silver. In contrast, iron, gold, and copper mines and deposits are closer to a more proportional distribution while showing a high concentration in the intermediate biodiversity zone. Considering the five metals together, 63{\%} and 61{\%} of available mines and deposits, respectively, are located in intermediate diversity zones, comprising 52{\%} of the global land terrestrial surface. 23{\%} of mines and 20{\%} of ore deposits are located in areas of high plant diversity, covering 17{\%} of the land. 13{\%} of mines and 19{\%} of deposits are in areas of low plant diversity, comprising 31{\%} of the land surface. Thus, there seems to be potential for opening new mines in areas of low biodiversity in the future.},

abstract = {Mountaintop removal and valley fill (MTR/VF) coal mining has altered the landscape of the Central Appalachian region in the USA. Among the changes are large-scale topographic recontouring, burial of headwater streams, and degradation of downstream water quality. The goals of our study were to: 1) compare the structure and function of natural and constructed streamchannels in forested and MTR/ VF catchments across ephemeral, intermittent, and perennial flow regimes and 2) assess the relationship between leaf litter breakdown and structural measures, such as the habitat assessments currently used by regulatory agencies. Specific conductance of stream water was, on average, 36 to 573 higher at perennial reaches below valley fills than at perennial reaches in forested catchments, whereas pH was circumneutral in both catchment types. Channel habitat and invertebrate assemblages in litter bags differed between forested streams and constructed channels in VF catchments. Invertebrate density, diversity, and biomass were typically higher in litter bags from forested catchments than from VF catchments. No differences in fungal biomass, estimated as ergosterol concentration, were detected between litter bags from forested and VF catchments. Breakdown of oak (Quercus alba) leaves was slower at perennial and intermittent reaches in VF catchments than at perennial and intermittent reaches in forested catchments. However, breakdown rates did not differ between ephemeral reaches on VFs and in forested catchments. Breakdown rates of oak leaves were significantly correlated to conductivity at perennial and intermittent reaches and to shredder diversity across all reaches, but were not correlated with habitat assessment scores currently being used to determine compensatory mitigation. Landuse changes associated with MTR/VF have detrimental consequences to headwater stream function that are not adequately evaluated using the prevalent habitat assessment.},

abstract = {Climate change could alter terrestrial ecosystems, which are important sources and sinks of the potent green-house gases (GHGs) nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4), in ways that either stimulate or decrease the magnitude and duration of global warming. Using manipulative field experiments, we assessed how N2O and CH4 soil fluxes responded to a rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration and to increased air temperature. Nitrous oxide and CH4 responses varied greatly among studied ecosystems. Elevated CO2 often stimulated N2O emissions in fertilized systems and CH4 emissions in wetlands, peatlands, and rice paddy fields; both effects were stronger in clayey soils than in sandy upland soils. Elevated temperature, however, impacted N2O and CH4 emissions inconsistently. Thus, the effects of elevated CO2 concentrations on N2O and CH4 emissions may further enhance global warming, but it remains unclear whether increased temperature generates positive or negative feedbacks on these GHGs in terrestrial ecosystems.},

We argue that a diversity of approaches to studying vulnerability is necessary in order to address the full complexity of the concept and that the approaches are in large part complementary. An emerging consensus on the issues of critical importance to vulnerability reduction—including concerns of equity and social justice—and growing synergy among conceptual frameworks promise even greater relevancy and utility for decision makers in the near future. We synthesize the current literature with an outline of core assessment components and key questions to guide the trajectory of future research.},

abstract = {Many calcified structures produce periodic growth increments useful for age determination at the annual or daily scale. However, age determination is invariably accompanied by various sources of error, some of which can have a serious effect on age-structured calculations. This review highlights the best available methods for insuring ageing accuracy and quantifying ageing precision, whether in support of large-scale production ageing or a small-scale research project. Included in this review is a critical overview of methods used to initiate and pursue an accurate and controlled ageing program, including (but not limited to) validation of an ageing method. The distinction between validation of absolute age and increment periodicity is emphasized, as is the importance of determining the age of first increment formation. Based on an analysis of 372 papers reporting age validation since 1983, considerable progress has been made in age validation efforts in recent years. Nevertheless, several of the age validation methods which have been used routinely are of dubious value, particularly marginal increment analysis. The two major measures of precision, average percent error and coefficient of variation, are shown to be functionally equivalent, and a conversion factor relating the two is presented. Through use of quality control monitoring, ageing errors are readily detected and quantified; reference collections are the key to both quality control and reduction of costs. Although some level of random ageing error is unavoidable, such error can often be corrected after the fact using statistical (‘digital sharpening') methods.},

abstract = {The start of the period of large-scale human effects on this planet (the Anthropocene) is debated. The industrial view holds that most significant impacts have occurred since the early industrial era (?1850), whereas the early-anthropogenic view recognizes large impacts thousands of years earlier. This review focuses on three indices of global-scale human influence: forest clearance (and related land use), emissions of greenhouse gases (CO2 and CH4), and effects on global temperature. Because reliable, systematic land-use surveys are rare prior to 1950, most reconstructions for early-industrial centuries and prior millennia are hind casts that assume humans have used roughly the same amount of land per person for 7,000 years. But this assumption is incorrect. Historical data and new archeological databases reveal much greater per-capita land use in preindustrial than in recent centuries. This early forest clearance caused much greater preindustrial greenhouse-gas emissions and global temperature changes than those proposed within the industrial paradigm.},

The technosphere is of global extent, exhibits large-scale appropriation of mass and energy resources, shows a tendency to co-opt for its own use information produced by the environment, and is autonomous. Unlike the older paradigms, the technosphere has not yet evolved the ability to recycle its own waste stream. Unless or until it does so, its status as a paradigm remains provisional. Humans are ‘parts' of the technosphere – subcomponents essential for system function. Viewed from the inside by its human parts, the technosphere is perceived as a derived and controlled construct. Viewed from outside as a geological phenomenon, the technosphere appears as a quasi-autonomous system whose dynamics constrains the behaviour of its human parts. A geological perspective on technology suggests why strategies to limit environmental damage that consider only the needs of people are likely to fail without parallel consideration of the requirements of technology, especially its need for an abundant supply of energy.},

@article{Hirota2007b,
abstract = {We measured fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO(2)), methane (CH(4)), and nitrous oxide (N(2)O) simultaneously in two typical fringing zones, sandy shore and salt marsh, of coastal lagoon, Lake Nakaumi, Japan, in mid-summer 2003. Our aim was to quantify net the greenhouse gases (GHGs) fluxes and examine key factors, which control variation of the GHGs fluxes in the two sites. Net CO(2) and CH(4) fluxes were markedly different between the two sites; magnitudes and variations of the both fluxes in sandy shore were lower than those of salt marsh. Meanwhile, magnitude and variation of net N(2)O flux in the two sites were similar. In sandy shore, temporal and spatial variation of the three GHGs fluxes were highly controlled by water level fluctuation derived from astronomic tide. In salt marsh, spatial variation of the three GHGs fluxes were correlated with aboveground biomass, and temporal variation of CO(2) and CH(4) fluxes were correlated with soil temperature. The sum of global warming potential, which was roughly estimated using the observed GHGs fluxes, was ca. 174-fold higher in salt marsh than in sandy shore.},

abstract = {Soil O-2 is an important regulator of microbial processes but is rarely measured. Consequently, our understanding of temporal and spatial variation in soil O-2 is limited. This, in turn, limits our understanding of a key regulator of N loss through microbial denitrification. In this study, we explored: (i) how soil O-2 varied seasonally in wet and dry riparian areas, (ii) how this variation in O-2 exposure translated into spatially heterogeneous areas of denitrification and denitrification potential, and (iii) how O-2, NO3-, and moisture interacted to affect denitrification rates. We collected continuous measurements of soil O-2 in "wet" and "dry" riparian soils and measured denitrification by removing the background N-2 headspace from intact soil cores, replacing it with a He-O-2 mixture, and measuring N-2 production with time. We found that soil O-2 varied considerably in the wet site, ranging from anoxic conditions when the water table was high in late spring to completely oxic conditions (20{\%} O-2) during summer when the water table dropped. In contrast, the dry site remained at 20{\%} nearly year round. Bulk soil O-2 strongly controlled denitrification rates in the wet site but not in the dry site, which only denitrified when NO3- was added. Denitrification enzyme activity was approximately twice as high in the wet site compared with the dry site, both of which responded predictably to O-2 exposure. Experimental manipulation of O-2, NO3-, and C may help to identify real hot and cold spots for denitrification in landscapes.},

abstract = {Difficulties in scaling up theoretical and experimental results have raised controversy over the consequences of biodiversity loss for the functioning of natural ecosystems. Using a global survey of reef fish assemblages, we show that in contrast to previous theoretical and experimental studies, ecosystem functioning (as measured by standing biomass) scales in a non-saturating manner with biodiversity (as measured by species and functional richness) in this ecosystem. Our field study also shows a significant and negative interaction between human population density and biodiversity on ecosystem functioning (i.e., for the same human density there were larger reductions in standing biomass at more diverse reefs). Human effects were found to be related to fishing, coastal development, and land use stressors, and currently affect over 75{\%} of the world's coral reefs. Our results indicate that the consequences of biodiversity loss in coral reefs have been considerably underestimated based on existing knowledge and that reef fish assemblages, particularly the most diverse, are greatly vulnerable to the expansion and intensity of anthropogenic stressors in coastal areas.},

abstract = {The revolutionary rise of broad-leaved (flowering) angiosperm plant species during the Cretaceous initiated a global ecological transformation towards modern biodiversity. Still, the mechanisms involved in this angiosperm radiation remain enigmatic. Here we show that the period of rapid angiosperm evolution initiated after the leaf interior (post venous) transport path length for water was reduced beyond the leaf interior transport path length for CO2 at a critical leaf vein density of 2.5-5 mm mm(-2). Data and our modelling approaches indicate that surpassing this critical vein density was a pivotal moment in leaf evolution that enabled evolving angiosperms to profit from developing leaves with more and smaller stomata in terms of higher carbon returns from equal water loss. Surpassing the critical vein density may therefore have facilitated evolving angiosperms to develop leaves with higher gas exchange capacities required to adapt to the Cretaceous CO2 decline and outcompete previously dominant coniferous species in the upper canopy.},

abstract = {Salt marshes are highly productive coastal wetlands that provide important ecosystem services such as storm protection for coastal cities, nutrient removal and carbon sequestration. Despite protective measures, however, worldwide losses of these ecosystems have accelerated in recent decades. Here we present data from a nine-year whole-ecosystem nutrient-enrichment experiment. Our study demonstrates that nutrient enrichment, a global problem for coastal ecosystems, can be a driver of salt marsh loss. We show that nutrient levels commonly associated with coastal eutrophication increased above-ground leaf biomass, decreased the dense, below-ground biomass of bank-stabilizing roots, and increased microbial decomposition of organic matter. Alterations in these key ecosystem properties reduced geomorphic stability, resulting in creek-bank collapse with significant areas of creek-bank marsh converted to unvegetated mud. This pattern of marsh loss parallels observations for anthropogenically nutrient-enriched marshes worldwide, with creek-edge and bay-edge marsh evolving into mudflats and wider creeks. Our work suggests that current nutrient loading rates to many coastal ecosystems have overwhelmed the capacity of marshes to remove nitrogen without deleterious effects. Projected increases in nitrogen flux to the coast, related to increased fertilizer use required to feed an expanding human population, may rapidly result in a coastal landscape with less marsh, which would reduce the capacity of coastal regions to provide important ecological and economic services.},

abstract = {We present a method for selecting entire microbial ecosystems for bioremediation and other practical purposes. A population of ecosystems is established in the laboratory, each ecosystem is measured for a desired property (in our case, degradation of the environmental pollutant 3-chloroaniline), and the best ecosystems are used as 'parents' to inoculate a new generation of 'offspring' ecosystems. Over many generations of variation and selection, the ecosystems become increasingly well adapted to produce the desired property. The procedure is similar to standard artificial selection experiments except that whole ecosystems, rather than single individuals, are the units of selection. The procedure can also be understood in terms of complex system theory as a way of searching a vast combinatorial space (many thousands of microbial species and many thousands of genes within species) for combinations that are especially good at producing the desired property. Ecosystem-level selection can be performed without any specific knowledge of the species that comprise the ecosystems and can select ensembles of species that would be difficult to discover with more reductionistic methods. Once a 'designer ecosystem' has been created by ecosystem-level selection, reductionistic methods can be used to identify the component species and to discover how they interact to produce the desired effect.},

abstract = {Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from a rice-duck cultivation system in the subtropical region of China and its regulating factors were investigated by using a static chambers technique during rice growth seasons in 2006 and 2007. The experimental field was equally divided into six plots for two different treatments: One was a conventional rice field (CK) and the other was a rice-duck ecosystem (RD). With the same amount of urea applied as basal fertilization, N2O emission fluxes from RD and CK followed a similar seasonal variation trend. During the flooding seasons, the N2O emission flux was not correlated with temperature, but it was significantly related to soil inorganic nitrogen (SIN) (p {\textless} 0.01) and soil pH (p {\textless} 0.01). After drainage, the N2O emission flux was not correlated with temperature, SIN, and soil pH. Our experimental data showed that peaks of N2O emission flux occurred both in 2 weeks after urea application and after drainage. Compared to CK, RD could significantly increase N2O emission. We evaluated the integrated global warming potentials (GWPs) of a rice-duck cultivation system based on methane (CH4) and N2O emission, which showed that RD could suppress the total amount of CH4 and N2O emissions from rice paddies. Moreover, because the decrease of CH4 emissions from RD compared to CK was far more than the increase of N2O emissions from RD compared to CK, RD greatly reduced integrated GWPs (CH4 + N2O) compared to CK. So, the rice-duck cultivation system is an effective strategy for reducing integrated GWPs of the rice-duck cultivation systems based on CH4 and N2O in southern China and will contribute to alleviating global warming.},

abstract = {The establishment of terrestrial plants during the Palaeozoic era was one of the most significant changes to the Earth system during the Phanerozoic eon. The continuing evolution and expansion of land plants irrevocably altered the alluvial landscape: the broad, unconfined and unconsolidated blankets of coarse sediment found at the start of the Cambrian periodwere replaced by a diverse array of braided and meandering channel styles and stable floodplains by the end of the Devonian period. Herewe showthat the first appearance of a sedimentary facies suite attributed to low-energy, organic-rich river systems with multiple channels and stable alluvial islands, known as anabranching or anastomosing rivers, occurred during the Carboniferous period. Our field studies and literature reviewdemonstrate that the appearance of these rivers coincides with the continuing evolution of tree-like plants. We suggest that increased floodplain stability and new triggers for channel avulsion were provided by the increase in complexity and diversity of root assemblages, density of floodplain forests and production of woody debris associated with expansion of arborescence.We conclude that the expansion of tree habitats led to the crossing of a threshold in vegetative control of floodplain and river morphology during the Carboniferous.},

The versatility and attractiveness of the wavelet approach lie in its decomposition properties, principally its time-scale localization. It is especially relevant to the analysis of non-stationary systems, i.e., systems with short-lived transient components, like those observed in ecological systems. Here, we review the basic properties of the wavelet approach for time-series analysis from an ecological perspective. Wavelet decomposition offers several advantages that are discussed in this paper and illustrated by appropriate synthetic and ecological examples. Wavelet analysis is notably free from the assumption of stationarity that makes most methods unsuitable for many ecological time series. Wavelet analysis also permits analysis of the relationships between two signals, and it is especially appropriate for following gradual change in forcing by exogenous variables.},

abstract = {We study the potentially unnecessary costs imposed by strict performance standards for forest restoration of surface coal mines in the Appalachian region under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA) that can vary widely across states. Both the unnecessary private costs to the mine operator and costs to society (social costs) are reported for two performance standards, a ground cover requirement, and a seedling survival target. These standards are examined using numerical analyses under a range of site productivity class and market conditions. We show that a strict (90{\%}) ground cover standard may produce an unnecessary private cost of more than {\$}700/ha and a social cost ranging from {\$}428/ha to {\$}710/ha, as compared with a 70{\%} standard. A strict tree survival standard of 1235 trees/ha, as compared with the more typical 1087 trees/ha standard, may produce an unnecessary private cost of approximately {\$}200/ha, and a social cost in the range of {\$}120 to {\$}208/ha. We conclude that strict performance standards may impose substantial unnecessary private costs and social costs, that strict performance standards may be discouraging the choice of forestry as a post-mining land use, and that opportunities exist for reform of reforestation performance standards. Our study provides a basis for evaluating tradeoffs between regulatory efficiency and optimal reforestation effort.},

We measured soil GHG concentrations and surface fluxes from six vegetation communities at a High Arctic polar oasis and adjacent polar deserts in order to identify regions within the soil profile of production and consumption of CO

Examined communities included two polar deserts differing in parent material and soil pH, and four lowland tundra communities: prostrate dwarf-shrub, herb tundra, prostrate/hemiprostrate dwarf-shrub tundra, nontussock sedge, dwarf-shrub, moss tundra and a sedge/grass, moss wetland, representative of large areas at lower Arctic latitudes. Polar desert soils were net producers of greenhouse gases during the brief High Arctic growing season, including at depths close to the permafrost layer, and effluxes from the surface were of a similar magnitude to nearby mesic and hydric tundra soils including for CO 
                        2, indicative of soil respiration in desert soils with few roots. Differences in water content, rather than calculated diffusivity, appear to drive gas transport in at least some soils, with all three GHG appearing to move rapidly through, for example, the soil at 10 cm above permafrost in the Prostrate (dominated by Dryas integrifolia) plant community. Such physical processes may obscure or falsely suggest biological processes in soil ecosystems. ?? 2012.},

abstract = {Artificial selection has been practiced for centuries to shape the properties of individual organisms, providing Darwin with a powerful argument for his theory of natural selection. We show that the properties of whole ecosystems can also be shaped by artificial selection procedures. Ecosystems initiated in the laboratory vary phenotypically and a proportion of the variation is heritable, despite the fact that the ecosystems initially are composed of thousands of species and millions of individuals. Artificial ecosystem selection can be used for practical purposes, illustrates an important role for complex interactions in evolution, and challenges a widespread belief that selection is most effective at lower levels of the biological hierarchy.},

abstract = {We introduce the term metacity as a conceptual framework that can be shared by ecologists and designers and applied across the wide variety of urban habitats found around the world. While the term metacity was introduced by UN-HABITAT to designate hyper cities of over twenty million people, for us it is not limited to large urban agglomerations, but rather refers to the proliferation of new forms of urbanization, each with distinct ecological and social attributes. These various urban configurations when combined with new digital sensing, communication and social networking technologies constitute a virtual meta-infrastructure, present in all cities today. This new metacity has the potential to integrate new activist forms of ecological and urban design research and practice in making the transition from sanitary to sustainable city models globally. The city of Baltimore, Maryland will be used both as a site to illustrate these recent urban trends, and also as an example of the integration of ecology and urban design pursued by the two authors over the past seven years [1,2]. Metacity theory is drawn from both an architectural analysis of contemporary forms of urbanism, new forms of digital monitoring and communication technologies, as well as metapopulation and metacommunity theories in ecology. We seek to provide tools and lessons from our experiences for realizing an integrated metacity approach to achieving social sustainability and ecological resilience on an increasingly urbanized planet.},

abstract = {Climatic effects on chemical weathering are evaluated by correlating variations On solute concentrations and fluxes with temperature, precipitation, runoff, and evapotranspiration (ET) for a worldwide distribution of sixty-eight watersheds underlain by granitoid rock types. Stream solute concentrations are strongly correlated with proportional ET loss, and evaporative concentration makes stream solute concentrations an inappropriate surrogate for chemical weathering. Chemical fluxes are unaffected by ET, and SiO2 and Na weathering fluxes exhibit systematic increases with precipitation, runoff, and temperature. However, warm and wet watersheds produce anomalously rapid weathering rates. A proposed model that provides an improved prediction of weathering rates over climatic extremes Os the product of linear precipitation and Arrhenius temperature functions. The resulting apparent activation energies based on SiO2 and Na fluxes are 59.4 and 62.5 kJ {\textperiodcentered} mol-1, respectively. The coupling between temperature and precipitation emphasizes the importance of tropical regions On global silicate weathering fluxes, and suggests it is not representative to use continental averages for temperature and precipitation On the weathering rate functions of global carbon cycling and climatic change models. Fluxes of K, Ca, and Mg exhibit no climatic correlation, implying that other processes, such as ion exchange, nutrient cycling, and variations On lithology, obscure any climatic signal. The correlation between yearly variations On precipitation and solute fluxes within individual watersheds Os stronger than the correlation between precipitation and solute fluxes of watersheds with different climatic regimes. This underscores the significance of transport-induced variability On controlling stream chemistry, and the importance of distinguishing between short-term and long-term climatic trends. No correlation exists between chemical fluxes and topographic relief or the extent of recent glaciation, implying that physical erosion rates do not have a critical influence on chemical weathering rates. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

abstract = {Standard scientific operations on Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 204 documented a horizon of massive gas hydrate and highly saline pore water ∼0-20 m below the southern summit of Hydrate Ridge offshore Oregon. The sediment zone lies near active seafloor gas venting, raising the possibility that free gas co-exists with gas hydrate in shallow subsurface layers where pore waters have become too saline to precipitate additional gas hydrate. Here we discuss a unique experiment that addresses this important concept. A 1-m-long pressurized core was retrieved from ∼14 m below sea floor at Site 1249 and slowly degassed at ∼0 °C in the laboratory over ∼178 h to determine in situ salinity and gas concentrations in the interval of massive gas hydrate. The core released ∼95 l of gas (predominantly methane), by far the greatest gas volume ever measured for a 1 m core at ambient shipboard pressure and temperature conditions. Geochemical mass-balance calculations and the pressure of initial gas release (4.2 MPa) both imply that pore waters had an in situ salinity approaching or exceeding 105 g kg-1, the approximate salinity required for a gas hydrate-free gas-brine system. Relatively high concentrations of propane and higher hydrocarbon gases at the start of core degassing also suggest the presence of in situ free gas. Gas hydrate, free gas and brine likely co-exist in shallow sediment of Hydrate Ridge. Near-seafloor brines, produced when rapid gas hydrate crystallization extracts large quantities of water, impact the distribution and cycling of gas and gas hydrate in this region and perhaps elsewhere. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Complexity theory predicts that local feedback processes may strongly affect the organization of ecosystems on larger spatial scales. Whether complexity leads to increased resilience and stability or to increased vulnerability and criticality remains one of the dominant questions in ecology. We present a combined theoretical and empirical study of complex dynamics in mineral- ogenic salt marsh ecosystems that emerge from a positive feedback between clay accumulation and plant growth. Positive feedback induces self-organizing within the ecosystem, which buffers for the strong physical gradient that characterizes the marine-terrestrial boundary, and improves plant growth along the gradient. However, as a consequence of these self-organizing properties, salt marshes approach a critical state as the edge of the salt marsh and the adjacent intertidal flat becomes increasingly steep and vulnerable to wave attack. Disturbance caused, for instance, by a storm may induce a cascade of vegetation collapse and severe erosion on the cliff edge, leading to salt marsh destruction. Our study shows that on short timescales, self-organization improves the functioning of salt marsh ecosystems. On long timescales, however, self-organization may lead to destruction of salt marsh vegetation.},

abstract = {Mountaintop removal mining (MTR) is a major industry in southern West Virginia with many detrimental effects for small to mid-sized streams, and interest in alternative, sustainable industries is on the rise. As a first step in a larger effort to assess the value of sport fisheries in southern West Virginia, we estimate the potential abundances of two popular sport fishes-smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) and brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis)-in the Coal River Basin (CRB). A self-thinning model that incorporates net primary production and terrestrial insect subsidies is first used to predict potential densities of adult (age 1+) smallmouth bass and brook trout. Predicted densities (fish ha(-1)) are then multiplied by the surface area of the CRB stream network (ha) to estimate regional abundance. Median predicted abundances of bass and trout are 38 806 and 118 094 fish (total abundances with the CRB), respectively. However, when streams that intersect permitted MTR areas in the CRB are removed from the dataset, predicted abundances of bass and trout decrease by {\~{}}12-14 {\%}. We conclude that significant potential exists in the CRB to capitalize on sport fisheries, but MTR may be undermining this potential.},

abstract = {Global increases in population, consumption, and gross domestic product raise concerns about the sustainability of the current and future use of natural resources. The human appropriation of net primary production (HANPP) provides a useful measure of human intervention into the biosphere. The productive capacity of land is appropriated by harvesting or burning biomass and by converting natural ecosystems to managed lands with lower productivity. This work analyzes trends in HANPP from 1910 to 2005 and finds that although human population has grown fourfold and economic output 17-fold, global HANPP has only doubled. Despite this increase in efficiency, HANPP has still risen from 6.9 Gt of carbon per y in 1910 to 14.8 GtC/y in 2005, i.e., from 13{\%} to 25{\%} of the net primary production of potential vegetation. Biomass harvested per capita and year has slightly declined despite growth in consumption because of a decline in reliance on bioenergy and higher conversion efficiencies of primary biomass to products. The rise in efficiency is overwhelmingly due to increased crop yields, albeit frequently associated with substantial ecological costs, such as fossil energy inputs, soil degradation, and biodiversity loss. If humans can maintain the past trend lines in efficiency gains, we estimate that HANPP might only grow to 27-29{\%} by 2050, but providing large amounts of bioenergy could increase global HANPP to 44{\%}. This result calls for caution in refocusing the energy economy on land-based resources and for strategies that foster the continuation of increases in land-use efficiency without excessively increasing ecological costs of intensification.},

abstract = {It is only recently that freshwaters have been identified as important quantitative components of the carbon (C) cycle at global and regional scales. To date there are no studies that quantitatively predict the effects of alterations in temperature and flow regimes, individually, or in concert, on organic C dynamics in streams. To address this need, we applied a mechanistic model to simulate organic C dynamics in Mediterranean river networks under 27 different scenarios of altered temperature and flow regimes. We predict that the organic C dynamics in freshwaters in the Mediterranean, as well as in other semiarid regions, will be highly sensitive to global climate change owing to major increases in the degree of intermittency as well as in flood frequency and magnitude. Results indicate that flow regime alterations increase C export rates, whereas temperature alterations increase instream metabolism of organic C. However, flow regime alterations exhibit a much greater influence on C dynamics than do changes in the temperature regime. Reservoirs partly counteract the effects of flow extremes on C export rates, and their role in the C dynamics increases with increasing flow variability. The present study is one of the first studies to quantify the complex interactions between the flow and the temperature regime on C dynamics, emphasizing the key role of extreme events such as dry periods and floods, compared with overall trend effects. This information is pivotal in understanding the impact of future climate change on global C dynamics.},

abstract = {The biogeochemical cycles of iron and organic carbon are strongly interlinked. In oceanic waters, organic ligands have been shown to control the concentration of dissolved iron. In soils, solid iron phases shelter and preserve organic carbon, but the role of iron in the preservation of organic matter in sediments has not been clearly established. Here we use an iron reduction method previously applied to soils to determine the amount of organic carbon associated with reactive iron phases in sediments of various mineralogies collected from a wide range of depositional environments. Our findings suggest that 21.5 ± 8.6 per cent of the organic carbon in sediments is directly bound to reactive iron phases. We further estimate that a global mass of (19-45) × 10(15) grams of organic carbon is preserved in surface marine sediments as a result of its association with iron. We propose that these associations between organic carbon and iron, which are formed primarily through co-precipitation and/or direct chelation, promote the preservation of organic carbon in sediments. Because reactive iron phases are metastable over geological timescales, we suggest that they serve as an efficient 'rusty sink' for organic carbon, acting as a key factor in the long-term storage of organic carbon and thus contributing to the global cycles of carbon, oxygen and sulphur.},

abstract = {Drought is expected to increase in frequency and severity in the future as a result of climate change, mainly as a consequence of decreases in regional precipitation but also because of increasing evaporation driven by global warming. Previous assessments of historic changes in drought over the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries indicate that this may already be happening globally. In particular, calculations of the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) show a decrease in moisture globally since the 1970s with a commensurate increase in the area in drought that is attributed, in part, to global warming. The simplicity of the PDSI, which is calculated from a simple water-balance model forced by monthly precipitation and temperature data, makes it an attractive tool in large-scale drought assessments, but may give biased results in the context of climate change. Here we show that the previously reported increase in global drought is overestimated because the PDSI uses a simplified model of potential evaporation that responds only to changes in temperature and thus responds incorrectly to global warming in recent decades. More realistic calculations, based on the underlying physical principles that take into account changes in available energy, humidity and wind speed, suggest that there has been little change in drought over the past 60 years. The results have implications for how we interpret the impact of global warming on the hydrological cycle and its extremes, and may help to explain why palaeoclimate drought reconstructions based on tree-ring data diverge from the PDSI-based drought record in recent years.},

abstract = {Despite the growing body of literature on ecosystem services, still many challenges remain to structurally integrate ecosystem services in landscape planning, management and design. This paper therefore aims to provide an overview of the challenges involved in applying ecosystem service assessment and valuation to environmental management and discuss some solutions to come to a comprehensive and practical framework.First the issue of defining and classifying ecosystem services is discussed followed by approaches to quantify and value ecosystem services. The main part of the paper is focussed on the question how to analyze trade-offs involved in land cover and land use change, including spatial analysis and dynamic modelling tools. Issues of scale are addressed, as well as the question how to determine the total economic value of different management states.Finally, developments and challenges regarding the inclusion of ecosystem services in integrative landscape planning and decision-making tools are discussed.It is concluded that the ecosystem service approach and ecosystem service valuation efforts have changed the terms of discussion on nature conservation, natural resource management, and other areas of public policy. It is now widely recognized that nature conservation and conservation management strategies do not necessarily pose a trade-off between the " environment" and " development" Investments in conservation, restoration and sustainable ecosystem use are increasingly seen as a " win-win situation" which generates substantial ecological, social and economic benefits. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The new field of 'stoichiogenomics' integrates evolution, ecology and bioinformatics to reveal surprising patterns of the differential usage of key elements [e.g. nitrogen (N)] in proteins and nucleic acids. Because the canonical amino acids as well as nucleotides differ in element counts, natural selection owing to limited element supplies might bias monomer usage to reduce element costs. For example, proteins that respond to N limitation in microbes use a lower proportion of N-rich amino acids, whereas proteome- and transcriptome-wide element contents differ significantly for plants as compared with animals, probably because of the differential severity of element limitations. In this review, we show that with these findings, new directions for future investigations are emerging, particularly via the increasing availability of diverse metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data sets.},

abstract = {Urban ecology and its theories are increasingly poised to contribute to urban sustainability, through both basic understanding and action. We present a conceptual framework that expands the Industrial. →. Sanitary. →. Sustainable City transition to include non-sanitary cities, "new cities", and various permutations of transition options for cities encountering exogenous and endogenous "triggers of change". When investigating and modeling these urban transitions, we should consider: (1) the triggers that have induced chan≥ (2) situations where crisis triggers chan≥ (3) why cities transition toward more sustainable states on their own, in the absence of crisis; (4) what we can learn from new city transitions, and non-sanitary city transitions; and (5) how resource interactions affect urban transitions. Several existing theoretical frameworks, including sustainability, resilience, adaptation, and vulnerability, may be helpful when considering urban transitions. We suggest that all of these theories interact through inertia in urban systems, and that this multi-faceted inertia-e.g. institutional inertia, infrastructural inertia, and social inertia-imparts degrees of rigidity that make urban systems less flexible and nimble when facing transitional triggers and change. Given this, solutions to urban sustainability challenges may be categorized as those: (1) that "tweak" the current systems and work with or even take advantage of the inertia in those systems, versus; (2) that are more "transformative", that confront systemic inertia, and that may require new systems. We propose that a model for addressing urban sustainability in the context of relevant theory, and for bridging research and practice, should focus on intercity comparisons. And one mechanism to facilitate this approach is a newly formed interdisciplinary Research Coordination Network (RCN) that focuses on urban sustainability by integrating urban research while incubating solutions-oriented products and collaborative partnerships with practitioners. The Network includes more than two dozen cities in five continents that are in various degrees of transition. In the true vein of sustainability science, our Network activities are incubating societally-relevant solutions through projects that will lead to tangible, "on the ground" sustainable solutions for all types of cities. Our ultimate goal is to understand the process by which cities become more sustainable while affecting that process through action inspired by knowledge. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Contemporary land-use pressures have a significant impact on the extent and condition of forests in the eastern United States, causing a regional-scale decline in forest cover. Earlier in the 20th century, land cover was on a trajectory of forest expansion that followed agricultural abandonment. However, the potential for forest regeneration has slowed, and the extent of regional forest cover has declined by more than 4.0{\%}. Using remote-sensing data, statistical sampling, and change-detection methods, this research shows how land conversion varies spatially and temporally across the East from 1973–2000, and how those changes affect regional land-change dynamics. The analysis shows that agricultural land use has continued to decline, and that this enables forest recovery; however, an important land-cover transition has occurred, from a mode of regional forest-cover gain to one of forest-cover loss caused by timber cutting cycles, urbanization, and other land-use demands.},

@article{Diodato1994a,
abstract = {Two nuclear methods were used to quantify hydrogeologic parameters in the unsaturated zone of a reclaimed and revegetated coal strip mine in Clarion, Pennsylvania. Am-Be (neutron) and Cs-137 (gamma-gamma) geophysical logging tools were used to quantify volumetric moisture content, bulk density, total porosity, and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity. An additional study at the same site used postsampling neutron activation analysis to determine concentrations of a bromide tracer in unsaturated zone water samples. Those additional data were used to independently calculate unsaturated hydraulic conductivity.Geophysical logging of six boreholes at the site was conducted on seven different dates. Temporal variations in volumetric moisture content versus depth were observed to be short-lived, with the general shape of the volumetric moisture content profiles remaining spatially stable over the eight month period of investigation. Bulk density values ranged from less than 1.14 to 1.86 g/cm3, corresponding to total porosities of greater than 57{\%} to 30.1{\%}. Large void spaces were encountered during past and present drilling and observed at a measurement point. Unsaturated hydraulic conductivities were calculated using draining profile volumetric moisture content data as input to an explicit numerical solution of the unsaturated flow equation. Calculated values ranged from 2.4 × 10−7 to 1.5 × 10 −3 cm/s. Examination of all of the geophysical log data together showed sharp increases in volumetric moisture content spatially coincident with zones where bulk density increases (and porosity decreases). The bulk density contrast appears to be of more influence than the magnitude of the material property. Increased unsaturated hydraulic conductivity associated with increased volumetric moisture content was seen in several boreholes.Bromide tracer-labeled waters were collected from pressure-suction lysimeters installed at depths of up to 18.1 m for a period of 16 months. Unsaturated hydraulic conductivities, calculated by interpreting concentration peaks as average arrival times of steadily infiltrating water through a uniformly porous media, ranged from 2.8 × 10−6 to 7.2 × 10−5 cm/s. However, a dual-permeability mechanism is suggested by the observed behavior of the tracer. Analysis of the data suggests that fluid flow in this hydrogeologic setting is dominantly transient. Ground-water recharge occurs in short-lived pulses. The periodicity of acid mine drainage formation and flushing to the water table is expected to correspond to infiltration and recharge events.},

@article{Prior2011,
abstract = {Today's global society is economically, socially and culturally dependent on minerals and metals. While metals are recyclable, terrestrial mineral deposits are by definition 'non-renewable' over human timescales and their stocks are thus finite. This raises the spectre of 'peak minerals' - the time at which production from terrestrial ores can no longer rise to meet demand and where a maximum (peak) production occurs. Peak minerals prompts a focus on the way minerals can be sustainably used in the future to ensure the services they provide to global society can be maintained. As peak minerals approaches (and is passed in some cases), understanding and monitoring the dynamics of primary mineral production, recycling and dematerialisation, in the context of national and global discussions about mineral resources demand and the money earned from their sale, will become essential for informing and establishing mechanisms for sustainable mineral governance and use efficiency into the future. Taking a cross-scale approach, this paper explores the economic and productivity impacts of peak minerals, and how changes in the mineral production profile are influenced not only by technological and scarcity factors, but also by environmental and social constraints. Specifically we examine the impacts of peak minerals in Australia, a major global minerals supplier, and the consequences for the Asia-Pacific region, a major destination for Australia's minerals. This research has profound implications for local and regional/global sustainability of mineral and metal use. The focus on services is useful for encouraging discussion of transitions in how such services can be provided in a future more sustainable economy, when mineral availability is constrained. The research also begins to address the question of how we approach the development of strategies to maximise returns from mineral wealth over generations. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Oxidation of pyrite in aqueous solutions in contact with air (oxygen 20{\%}) was studied at 25°C using short-term batch experiments. Fe2+ and SO42- were the only dissolved Fe and S species detected in these solutions. After a short period, R = [S]tot/[Fe]tot stabilized from 1.25 at pH = 1.5 to 1.6 at pH = 3. These R values were found to be consistent with previously published measurements (as calculated from the raw published data). This corresponds to a nonstoichiometric dissolution (R {\textless} 2) resulting from a deficit in aqueous sulfur. Thermodynamics indicate that S(-I) oxidation can only produce S(s)0 and SO42- under these equilibrium conditions. However, Pourbaix diagrams assuming the absence of SO42- indicate that S2O32- and S4 O62- can appear in these conditions. Using these species the simplest expected oxidation mechanism is FeS2(s) + 1.5O2 → Fe2+ + S2O32- followed by S2O32- + 1.2H+ → 0.4S(s)0 + 0.4S4O62- + 0.6H2O, and finally S4O62- + 3.5O2 + 3H2O → 4SO42- + 6H+ possibly in several steps The overall reaction is FeS2 + 2.9O22O → Fe2+ + 0.4S(s)0 + 1.6SO42- + 1.2H+, consistent with R = 1.6. In the most acidic (pH = 1.5) conditions, SO2 formation is expected as an intermediate step in the oxidation of S4 O62- to SO42-. Degassing of SO2(g) would result in R {\textless} 1.6, again consistent with experimental observations. The above multistep mechanism, based on known aqueous redox chemistry of sulfur species, accounts for the deficit in aqueous sulfur noticed in all published experimental observations. The intermediate species cannot be detected, and it is consistent with calculated concentrations being below the detection limits. Under nonacidic conditions, S2O32- can be detected, but evaluation of the dissolution mechanism is hindered by precipitation of Fe(III) as iron oxyhydroxides.

abstract = {Anthropogenic salinization of freshwaters is a global concern. Coal surface mining causes release of dissolved sulfate, bicarbonate, calcium, magnesium, and other ions to surface waters in central Appalachia, USA, through practices that include mine rock disposal in valley fills (VFs). This region's surface waters naturally have low salinity, with specific conductance (SC, a salinity indicator) generally {\textless}200 $\mu$S/cm, and aquatic impacts have been found when SC exceeds the 300 to 500 $\mu$S/cm range. We analyzed SC in waters emerging from 137 VFs over periods of 1 to 23 years. Mean SCs for these VFs ranged from 227 to 2,866 $\mu$S/cm, generally rose during and immediately following construction, but often declined during latter portions of longer monitoring records. Seventy-four of 103 VFs with postconstruction data had SC trends that fit negative quadratic forms. Of the 16 revegetated VFs with at least five years of SC data past the quadratic maximum, the mean quadratic maximum was 1,464 (±696) $\mu$S/cm and the model projected time required to approach natural conditions (by declining to {\textless}500 $\mu$S/cm) was 19.6 (±6.6) years after VF construction initiation, indicating long-lasting but not permanent aquatic impacts due to elevated ({\textgreater}500 $\mu$S/cm) SC.},

abstract = {Biological dinitrogen fixation provides the largest input of nitrogen to the oceans, therefore exerting important control on the ocean's nitrogen inventory and primary productivity. Nitrogen-isotope data from ocean sediments suggest that the marine-nitrogen inventory has been balanced for the past 3,000 years (ref. 4). Producing a balanced marine-nitrogen budget based on direct measurements has proved difficult, however, with nitrogen loss exceeding the gain from dinitrogen fixation by approximately 200 Tg N yr−1 (refs 5, 6). Here we present data from the Atlantic Ocean and show that the most widely used method of measuring oceanic N2-fixation rates underestimates the contribution of N2-fixing microorganisms (diazotrophs) relative to a newly developed method. Using molecular techniques to quantify the abundance of specific clades of diazotrophs in parallel with rates of 15N2 incorporation into particulate organic matter, we suggest that the difference between N2-fixation rates measured with the established method and those measured with the new method can be related to the composition of the diazotrophic community. Our data show that in areas dominated by Trichodesmium, the established method underestimates N2-fixation rates by an average of 62{\%}. We also find that the newly developed method yields N2-fixation rates more than six times higher than those from the established method when unicellular, symbiotic cyanobacteria and $\gamma$-proteobacteria dominate the diazotrophic community. On the basis of average areal rates measured over the Atlantic Ocean, we calculated basin-wide N2-fixation rates of 14 ± 1 Tg N yr−1 and 24 ±1 Tg N yr−1 for the established and new methods, respectively. If our findings can be extrapolated to other ocean basins, this suggests that the global marine N2-fixation rate derived from direct measurements may increase from 103 ± 8 Tg N yr−1 to 177 ± 8 Tg N yr−1, and that the contribution of N2 fixers other than Trichodesmium is much more significant than was previously thought.},

abstract = {This review assesses the state of the science on the effects of mountaintop mines and valley fills (MTM-VF) on the physicochemical characteristics of streams in the central Appalachian coalfields of West Virginia, Kentucky, Virginia and Tennessee, USA. We focus on the impacts of mountaintop removal coal mining, which involves removing all - or some portion - of the top of a mountain or ridge to expose and mine one or more coal seams. Excess overburden is disposed in constructed fills in small valleys adjacent to the mining site. MTM-VF leachate persistently increases the downstream concentrations of major ions. Conductivity is a coarse measure of these ions, which are dominated by a distinct mixture of SO(4)(2-), HCO(3)(-), Ca(2+) and Mg(2+), that reflects their source, the oxidation of pyrite to form acid followed by neutralization of the acidity by carbonate minerals within the valley fills. This results in neutral to alkaline pHs, a range at which many metals are relatively insoluble. Other compounds within coal or overburden are solubilized and occur at elevated albeit lower concentrations, including K(+), Na(+), Cl(-), Se and Mn. In terms of physical characteristics, the valley fills act like headwater aquifers, baseflows increase in streams below valley fills and water temperatures exhibit reduced seasonal variation. Peak discharges may be increased in response to intense precipitation events, because of compaction of base surfaces of the MTM-VF areas, but newer approaches to reclamation reduce this compaction and may ameliorate these peak flows. Although the sedimentation pond is intended to capture fine particles that wash downstream from the valley fill, some studies found increased fine sediments in streams downstream from valley fills. However, a proportion of these fines may be eroded from stream banks rather than the valley fills. This is probably a result of the alterations in stream flows.},

abstract = {In the coming decades, a crucial challenge for humanity will be meeting future food demands without undermining further the integrity of the Earth's environmental systems. Agricultural systems are already major forces of global environmental degradation, but population growth and increasing consumption of calorie- and meat-intensive diets are expected to roughly double human food demand by 2050 (ref. 3). Responding to these pressures, there is increasing focus on 'sustainable intensification' as a means to increase yields on underperforming landscapes while simultaneously decreasing the environmental impacts of agricultural systems. However, it is unclear what such efforts might entail for the future of global agricultural landscapes. Here we present a global-scale assessment of intensification prospects from closing 'yield gaps' (differences between observed yields and those attainable in a given region), the spatial patterns of agricultural management practices and yield limitation, and the management changes that may be necessary to achieve increased yields. We find that global yield variability is heavily controlled by fertilizer use, irrigation and climate. Large production increases (45{\%} to 70{\%} for most crops) are possible from closing yield gaps to 100{\%} of attainable yields, and the changes to management practices that are needed to close yield gaps vary considerably by region and current intensity. Furthermore, we find that there are large opportunities to reduce the environmental impact of agriculture by eliminating nutrient overuse, while still allowing an approximately 30{\%} increase in production of major cereals (maize, wheat and rice). Meeting the food security and sustainability challenges of the coming decades is possible, but will require considerable changes in nutrient and water management.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Contraction of cardiac myocytes is initiated by Ca(2+) entry through the voltage-dependent L-type Ca(2+) channel (LTCC). Previous studies have shown that phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase signaling modulates LTCC function. Because PI 3-kinases are key mediators of insulin action, we investigated whether LTCC function is affected in diabetic animals due to reduced PI 3-kinase signaling. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used whole-cell patch clamping and biochemical assays to compare cardiac LTCC function and PI 3-kinase signaling in insulin-deficient diabetic mice heterozygous for the Ins2(Akita) mutation versus nondiabetic littermates. RESULTS: Diabetic mice had a cardiac contractility defect, reduced PI 3-kinase signaling in the heart, and decreased L-type Ca(2+) current (I(Ca,L)) density in myocytes compared with control nondiabetic littermates. The lower I(Ca,L) density in myocytes from diabetic mice is due at least in part to reduced cell surface expression of the LTCC. I(Ca,L) density in myocytes from diabetic mice was increased to control levels by insulin treatment or intracellular infusion of PI 3,4,5-trisphosphate PI(3,4,5)P(3). This stimulatory effect was blocked by taxol, suggesting that PI(3,4,5)P(3) stimulates microtubule-dependent trafficking of the LTCC to the cell surface. The voltage dependence of steady-state activation and inactivation of I(Ca,L) was also shifted to more positive potentials in myocytes from diabetic versus nondiabetic animals. PI(3,4,5)P(3) infusion eliminated only the difference in voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation of I(Ca,L). CONCLUSIONS: Decreased PI 3-kinase signaling in myocytes from type 1 diabetic mice leads to reduced Ca(2+) entry through the LTCC, which might contribute to the negative effect of diabetes on cardiac contractility.},

abstract = {Abstract The second largest zone of coastal hypoxia (oxygen-depleted waters) in the world is found on the northern Gulf of Mexico continental shelf adjacent to the outflows of the Mississippi and Atchafalaya Rivers. The combination of high freshwater discharge, wind mixing, regional circulation, and summer warming controls the strength of stratification that goes through a well-defined seasonal cycle. The physical structure of the water column and high nutrient loads that enhance primary production lead to an annual formation of the hypoxic water mass that is dominant from spring through late summer. Paleoindicators in dated sediment cores indicate that hypoxic conditions likely began to appear around the turn of the last century and became more severe since the 1950s as the nitrate flux from the Mississippi River to the Gulf of Mexico tripled. Whereas increased nutrients enhance the production of some organisms, others are eliminated from water masses (they either emigrate from the area or die) where the...},

abstract = {We use a simple model of ecosystem management to demonstrate that ap- parently rational management approaches can lead to ecological collapse. Our model of the ecosystem management of lake eutrophication integrates lake dynamics, management decision-making, and learning in a framework that is deliberately simplified to highlight the role of model uncertainty. The simulated lake can switch between alternate eutrophic and oligotrophic states. Managers consider two management models of the lake, one for an oligotrophic lake and the other for a eutrophic lake. As managers observe the lake varying from year to year, they estimate how well each of the two management models is supported by the observed data. Management policies maximize the expected net present value of the lake. Even under optimistic assumptions about environmental variation, learning ability, and management control, conventional decision theory and optimal control ap- proaches fail to stabilize ecological dynamics. Rather, these methods drive ecosystems into cycles of collapse and recovery. We suggest how scientists could help prevent ecosystem management from driving ecosystems toward collapse.},

Numerous studies, however, have shown negative socioeconomic outcomes in extractive communities, supporting the notion that resources can be more of a curse than a blessing. One aspect of this debate that requires further clarification is the role played by method of extraction. In this article, we use the case of West Virginia coal mining and a fixed effects model to test whether extraction methods affect socioeconomic outcomes. We observe little difference in these outcomes between surface and underground mining; rather, it is the presence or absence of mining that matters most. We find that nonmining counties have lower poverty and unemployment rates than mining counties. These results lead us to conclude that leaving remaining coal stores in the ground will likely prove most beneficial to the states people and economy in the long run.},

However, proponents of sustainable development differ in their emphases on what is to be sustained, what is to be developed, howto link environment and development, and for how long a time. Despite the persistent definitional ambi- guities associated with sustainable development, much work (over 500 efforts) has been devoted to developing quantitative indicators of sustainable development. The emphasis on sustainability indicators has multiple motivations that include decision making and management, advocacy, participation and consensus building, and research and analysis.We select a dozen prominent examples and use this review to highlight their similarities and differences in definition of sustainable development, motivation, process, and technical methods. We conclude that there are no indicator sets that are universally accepted, backed by compelling theory, rigorous data collection and anal- ysis, and influential in policy. This is due to the ambiguity of sustainable development, the plurality of purpose in characterizing and measuring sustainable development, and the confusion of terminology, data, and methods of measurement. A major step in reducing such confusion would be the acceptance of distinctions in terminology, data, and methods. Toward this end, we propose an analytical framework that clearly distin- guishes among goals, indicators, targets, trends, driving forces, and policy responses. We also highlight the need for continued research on scale, aggregation, critical limits, and thresholds.},

So far, evidence for this idea has remained elusive, and integrated climate models assume smooth vegetation responses. We analyzed data on the distribution of tree cover in Africa, Australia, and South America to reveal strong evidence for the existence of three distinct attractors: forest, savanna, and a treeless state. Empirical reconstruction of the basins of attraction indicates that the resilience of the states varies in a universal way with precipitation. These results allow the identification of regions where forest or savanna may most easily tip into an alternative state, and they pave the way to a new generation of coupled climate models.},

These include collapse of the former Soviet Union, and its subsequent decade-long struggle for stability, the collapse of the Asian financial market and its contagious effects on world markets, increases in connectivity through the Internet, and increased migration of people (forced and not). There have been dramatic changes in global ecological systems -- from climate change that is already upon us, to the ozone hole and the emergence and propagation of novel diseases. The tragedy of AIDS, its origins, transformation and dispersion because of land use and social changes, is a signal of deep and broad changes that will yield further surprises and crises. More and more evidence accumulates that global climate change has already produced an increase in severe weather that, combined with inappropriate coastal development, has caused dramatic rises in insurance claims and human loss of life. Still other more subtle changes linking ecological, economic and social forces are occurring on a global scale such as the typical example described in Box 1-1, regarding collapse of fisheries.},

abstract = {Each family of the desert isopod Hemilepistus reaumuri uses its faeces to build an embankment around its burrow entrance in the form of a ring with an inner radius of 5-10 cm and an outer radius of 8-15 cm. Although the embankment, like the burrow entrance, is detected only by contact with the antennae, it facilitates the return to the burrow after an excursion. When a desert isopod returns from foraging it reaches the burrow entrance itself (diameter 12 mm) only in ca. 12{\%} of the observed cases by "dead reckoning"; the embankment, however, is reached six times more frequently. After detecting this landmark an isopod needs a further 12{\%} of the pathlength of the preceding excursion to locate the burrow entrance. In contrast, it travels five times further to reach its burrow from the same distance (10 cm) if the landmark is missing. The landmark is even more important when the isopod, because of a large error in orientation, can reach its burrow only by searching. Both the characteristics of the search path of H. reaumuri and the success of it's search behaviour correspond well to the respective features of a theoretical procedure, which best solves the search problem of the desert isopods assuming that a landmark is available for orientation. The optimal search procedure was calculated by using information about the probability density that an error in orientation has a given size, and the cumulative probability that the landmark is detected if the isopod searches in it's region with a given intensity. The coupling of the systematic search strategy of H. reaumuri with landmark orientation shortens the average time needed for homing by one-third. It helps an isopod to return to it's burrow after foraging even if all the orientation mechanisms normally used for this task have broken down.},

abstract = {Description of soil seed pools in stable and seral vegetation have frequently been based on one sample in time and space (Cook 1980, Roberts 1981). Soil seed pools are thus rarely monitored in different seasons at the same site. Such patterns might be important in explaining successional processes such as the recovery of sagebrush semi-desert (West 1983) after fire. All previous studies of soil seed pools in sagebrush- grass vegetation (Young and Evans 1975, 1977, Young et al. 1976) have taken place on sites that were seriously depleted of their perennial grass component by exces- sive livestock grazing. Our study site had a modicum of the introduced annual grass Bromus tectorum and much native perennial bunchgrass prior to fire (West and Hassan 1985). This area had not been burned for at least the past 100 yr, as indicated by the size and form of the fire-susceptible, nonsprouting and long- lived Artemisia tridentata ssp. wyomingensis and the few scattered Juniperus osteosperma. We measured the importance of soil seed pools in the regeneration of vegetation after a mid-summer (26 July 1981) wildfire near Mills in Juab County, Utah. Details on the location and environment of the study site, the wildfire, and recovery of the vegetation have been published by West and Hassan (1985). Here we describe the soil seed pools on burned and unburned plots over the first 15 mo following the fire.},

abstract = {A genetical mathematical model is described which allows for inter- actions between relatives on one another's fitness. Making use of Wright's Coefficient of Relationship as the measure of the proportion of replica genes in a relative, a quantity is found which incorporates the maximizing property of Darwinian fitness. This quantity is named “inclusive fitness”. Species following the model should tend to evolve behaviour such that each organism appears to be attempting to maximize its inclusive fitness. This implies a limited restraint on selfish competitive behaviour and possibility of limited self-sacrifices. Special cases of the model are used to show (a) that selection in the social situations newly covered tends to be slower than classical selection, (b) how in populations of rather non-dispersive organisms the model may apply to genes affecting dispersion, and (c) how it may apply approximately to competition between relatives, for example, within sibships. Some artificialities of the model are discussed.},

Accordingly, several approaches using a variety of data-including patterns of DNA variability, spatial and temporal changes in allele frequencies, and fitness estimates-have been developed to identify and quantify selection on both genotypes and phenotypes. Here, we review these approaches, drawing on both recent and classic examples to illustrate their utility and limitations. We then argue that by combining estimates of selection at multiple levels-from individual mutations to phenotypes-and at multiple timescales-from ecological to evolutionary-with experiments that demonstrate why traits are under selection, we can gain a much more complete picture of the adaptive process.},

The post-war rise of climate and weather modification and the history of U.S. assessments of the CO2-climate problem is reviewed. Proposals to engineer the climate are shown to be an integral element of this history. Climate engineering is reviewed with an emphasis on recent developments, including low-mass space-based scattering systems for altering the planetary albedo, simulation of the climate's response to albedo modification, and new findings on iron fertilization in oceanic ecosystems. There is a continuum of human responses to the climate problem that vary in resemblance to hard geoengineering schemes such as space-based mirrors. The distinction between geoengineering and mitigation is therefore fuzzy. A definition is advanced that clarifies the distinction between geoengineering and industrial carbon management. Asse...},

Alewife, smelt and most of the other planktivores in the lake probably consumed eggs, and at least alewife and smelt are known to consume larvae. For each species, I comment on the probable role of predation on early life history stages in their decline. Several species which currently co-exist with alewife and smelt have shown large scale declines during the increase of the exotics. Recruitment declines were often dramatic and the probability of predation on these species during their early life history is evaluated.},

abstract = {Wetland soil oxygen (O2) is rarely measured, which limits our understanding of a key regulator of nitrogen loss through denitrification. We asked: (1) How does soil [O2] vary in riparian wetlands? (2) How does this [O2] variation affect denitrification rates and end products? and (3) How does [O2] variation and previous exposure to O2affect trace gas fluxes? We collected a continuous seven-month record of [O2] dynamics in a “wet” and “dry” riparian zone. In April 2009, soil [O2] ranged from 0 to 13{\%} and consistently increased with increasing distance from the stream. [O2] gradually declined in all sensors until all sensors went anoxic in early September 2009. In mid-fall, a dropping water table increased soil [O2] to 15–20{\%} within a 2–3 day period. We measured denitrification using the Nitrogen-Free Air Recirculation Method (N-FARM), a direct measurement of N2 production against a helium background. Denitrification rates were significantly higher in the wetter areas, which correlated to lower O2 conditions. Denitrification rates in the drier areas correlated with [O2] in the early spring and summer, but significantly decreased in late summer despite decreasing O2 concentrations. Increasing [O2] significantly increased core N2O production, and therefore may be an important control on nitrous oxide yield. Field N2O fluxes, however, were highly variable, ranging from 0 to 800 ug N m−2 hr−1 with no differences between the wet and dry sites. Future research should focus on understanding the biotic and abiotic controls on O2 dynamics, and O2 dynamics should be included in models of soil N cycling and trace gas fluxes.},

abstract = {"Restoration Ecology" explores the interface between restoration ecology and ecological restoration. It aims at introducing Masters and PhD students, teachers, researchers and natural-resource managers to interactions between theory and practice. This book challenges ecologists to explore the applicability of current theories and concepts, recognizing that these have not been developed with such applications in mind. The academic foundations of restoration ecology are revisited for this purpose, to pave the way towards a review of the causes of successes and failures and to identify the perspectives of ecological restoration in different ecosystem types. These are dealt with biome-by-biome and considered from the historical perspective of land use. The final section addresses problems of ecological restoration in a societal context - ecological restoration is meant to achieve sustainable, resilient and interconnected ecosystems and socioecological systems. This will result in newly emerging ecosystems.},

abstract = {Ecologists have concluded that diversity per se in ecosystems is important to ecosystem function and ecological services. Meta-analyses of several hundred investigations showed that a loss of diversity negatively affected ecosystem function (Balvanera et al., 2006; Cardinale et al., 2006, 2011; Tilman, 2012). Specifically, research showed that loss of species diversity decreased productivity, resilience, nutrient cycling, drought tolerance, options for water management, resistance to pests and efficiency of ecosystems while increasing chances of catastrophic disease (Keesing et al., 2010; Tilman, 2012; Washington, 2013). Yet, the planet's biodiversity is affected by explosions in human population, advancing technology and increasing per capita consumption (Wilson, 2002). Lately, some propose that the future of conservation lies in managing nature for human benefit (Kareiva {\&} Marvier, 2007; Kareiva et al., 2007; Nordhaus {\&} Shellenberger, 2007; Marris, 2011; Kareiva, Lalasz {\&} Marvier, 2012a; Duncan, 2013). Directing conservation action for human benefit is nothing new. It recycles the ideas of Gifford Pinchot, maximum sustainable yield and the Brundtland Commission. Here, we critique some recent assumptions in the various forms of this ideology (hereafter, ideology), many of which use human exceptionalism as a justification: (1) nature is a warehouse for human use; (2) humans can construct new ecosystems from non-native species; (3) humans do not have to live within limits; (4) nature is resilient; (5) nature is a social construct; (6) conservationists preach too much doom and gloom; (7) people can manage nature intensively while preserving biodiversity.},

abstract = {Surface coal mining in Appalachia disturbs hundreds of hectares of land every year with the removal of valuable and ecologically diverse eastern deciduous forests. After the passage of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act in 1977, coal mine operators began planting a variety of grasses and legumes as a fast and economical way to reestablish a permanent vegetative cover to meet erosion and site stabilization requirements. However, soil compaction and competitive forage species have arrested the recolonization of native hardwood tree species on these reclaimed sites. Three 2.8-ha demonstration plots were established at Catenary Coal's Samples Mine in Kanawha County, West Virginia, of weathered brown sandstone and unweathered gray sandstone. Half of each plot was compacted. Each plot was hydroseeded with a low-competition herbaceous cover and planted with 11 hardwood tree species. After eight growing seasons, average tree volume index was nearly 10 times greater for trees grown in the brown sandstone treatments, 3853 cm(3), compared with 407 cm(3) in gray sandstone. Trees growing on compacted treatments had a lower mean volume index, 2281 cm(3), than trees growing on uncompacted treatments, 3899 cm(3). Average pH of brown sandstone was 5.2 to 5.7, while gray sandstone was 7.9. The gray sandstone had much lower fine soil fraction ({\textless}2-mm) content (40{\%}) than brown sandstone (70{\%}), which influenced nutrient-and water-holding capacity. Brown sandstone showed significantly greater tree growth and survival and at this stage is a more suitable topsoil substitute than gray sandstone on this site.},

@misc{Latour2000,
abstract = {Pandora's Hope was one of the first books I reviewed on this blog. It's a fairly short review, partially because I was still trying to absorb the basics of actor-network theory at the time. This second reading comes after several other books and articles on ANT. So I'll be a bit more detailed in my comments this time. Latour begins with the question of what science actually is, framing it with the story of an encounter with a scientist who nervously asks him if he believes in reality. Of course he does, Latour says. The rest of the book is a discussion of what that means -- a difficult proposition, Latour maintains, because of the way the world has been divided between subjects and objects. This modernist settlement has led us away from commonsensical statements and to a point at which we must discuss whether we believe in reality in the first place! To illuminate, Latour takes us in Chapter 2 to Brasil, where he follows an interdisciplinary set of scientists who are examining the dividing line between a savannah and a forest. How is their work done? Through a set of circulating references, Latour says: representations that themselves become represented by other representatives. "A word replaces a thing," he notes, "while conserving a trait that defines it" (p.63). The inscriptions that science mobilizes together constitute long chains of representation that typically converge into something about the size of a tabletop -- whether the thing that is represented is a galaxy, a microbe, or the soil underneath a savannah. And this chain renders the subject-object distinction useless -- and a bit ridiculous, in Latour's view. "Knowlendge, it seems, does not reside in the face-to-face confrontation of a mind with an object, any more than the reference designates a thing by means of a sentence verified by that thing." Rather, it resides in the long cascade of re-representations. An essential property of this chain is that it must remain reversible. The succession of changes must be traceable, allowing for travel in both directions. If the chain is interrupted at any point, it ceases to transport truth -- ceases, that is, to produce, to construct, to trace, and to conduct it. The word "reference" designates the quality of the chain in its entirety, and no longer adequatio rei et intellectus. (p.69) The principle is nicely illustrated on p.71, in which "the transformation at each stage of the reference ... may be pictured as a trade-off between what is gained (amplification) and what is lost (reduction) at each information-producing step." In the diagram, successive steps lead to narrower locality, particularity, materiality, multiplicity, and continuity, but greater compatibility, standardization, text, calculation, circulation, and relative universality -- that is, the transformation leads us to representations that are less rich but more calculable and transportable. Transformations lose some properties but gain others. Conducting a phenomenon in this way, in successive layers, makes it more real (p.76). It is the erasure of these intermediate steps that causes us to believe in the subject-object distinction. With that in mind, we go to Chapter 3, in which Latour discusses translation by using the historical case of Joliot attempting to develop an artificial nuclear chain reaction. Such a feat required a long set of translations: "when their goals are frustrated, actors take detours through the goals of others, resulting in a general drift, the language of one actor being substituted for the language of another" (p.89). Dautry's goal, national independence, can be reached only by taking a detour through Joliot's goal, being the first to master a chain reaction. Joliot's goal can only be reached by building a laboratory that can help to reach both goals. These detours link together very different sorts of enterprises, resulting in an interesting drift as the chain of translations expands, a drift from the exoteric to the esoteric. Some of the actors are humans, like Dautry and Joliot, but others are nonhumans, such as neutrons that must be persuaded to slow enough to hit a uranium atom. "For Joliot, it wasn't very difficult. In the morning he dealt with the neutrons and in the afternoon he dealt with the minister. The more time passed, the more these two problems became one" (p.90). Based on this work, Latour proposes that scientific facts are created and maintained through a "circulatory system" with five loops: mobilization, autonomization, alliances, public representations -- and the loops that knot them all together, the "links and knots" that are typically considered the scientific concept. In the modernist subject-object understanding, this last loop is conceived as an inner core surrounded by context; in the amodernist understanding being promoted here, it is one loop among others, moving and changing rather than transcendant and static. "A concept does not become scientific because it is farther removed from the rest of what it holds, but because it is more intensely connected to a much larger repertoire of resources" (p.108). This leads us to Chapter 4, where Latour returns to Louis Pasteur's work to suggest that we stop worrying about whether facts are constructed or real. Of course they are both -- and the shifting out of one plane of reference to another is what makes this doable (p.130). Latour suggests that instead of thinking of the world in terms of statements that allow words to correspond to the world (i.e., bridge the subject-object divide), we turn to a model of propositions in which we examine which propositions are articulated with one another (p.142). Chapter 5 takes up a common criticism of ANT, which is its lack of historicity. Following his standard pattern, Latour outlines two understandings of historicity, using the illustration of the microbe. "Did ferments exist before Pasteur made them up?" (p.145). If the question is in terms of representations, the answer is no: the notion of the microbe didn't come into being until Pasteur. If the question is in terms of evolution, the answer is yes: microbes were really there, but hadn't been named or theorized. But this is the words-and-world, subject-and-object distinction all over again: "the divide between what pertains to human history and what to natural history would not have been bridged in the slightest" (p.146). To overcome the distinction, Latour turns back to the notion of circulating reference from Chapter 2. Every change in the series of transformations makes a difference (p.150); "Associations of entities have a history if at least one of the articles making them up changes" (p.152). So an amodern account of historicity is grounded in changes in associations. And such a historicity is reversible; no inertia is enough to keep up the reality that has been so difficult to produce" (p.155). Settlements can unravel. Scientific facts have relative existence (p.156), an existence that takes hard work to keep up. Victories always require further actions (p.168). And now we get to another of Latour's diagrams (p.171), this one illustrating an amodernist historicity of Pasteur's work. The X axis is the "linear succession of time," while the Y axis is the "sedimentary succession of time" -- the year 1864 as it is represented in subsequent years. The 1864 of 1864 was not the same as the 1864 of 2005: in the earlier sedimentation, spontaneous generation was a serious theory that had to be addressed with careful methodology, whereas in the later sedimentation, we don't consider spontaneous generation seriously. The concepts become rearticulated and reread in later history. (From my own research: the concept of universal service became rearticulated in the 1970s, then was read back into Theodore Vail's 1907 statement on universal service as well as the Communications Act of 1934, neither of which originally shared the 1970s-era understanding of universal service.) Now for Chapter 6, in which Latour talks about mediation. How do we deal with technical mediation and the questions it poses for agency? Do guns kill people or do people kill people? Latour sees the subject-object dichotomy in this question as well, and characteristically proposes a middle ground through his account of technical mediation. Mediation, he says, involves mutual transformation of the assemblage (in this case, the gun-human), and this transformation has four parts: First, translation: "we can portray the relation between two agents as a translation of their goals which results in a composite goal that is different from the two original goals" (p.179). Second: Composition. "Action is simply not a property of humans but of an association of actants" (p.182). This composition of different agents in an assemblage is enacted through a series of "subprograms" that together achieve the composite goal of the assemblage. Third: Reversible blackboxing. An assemblage (composition) of agents can be "blackboxed" or regarded as a single entity. But if the settlement breaks down, the black box can open; the composition can unravel as easily as it was raveled. In Aramis, for instance, Latour demonstrates how engineers labor to turn a field, a set of motors, a set of citizens, and innumerable other humans and nonhumans into a public transportation system. If blackboxing works, you can say, "I'm taking the train to the meeting." If the black box is opened, you might say, "the drivers are on strike" or "there's something wrong with the engine." Technical and scientific settlements need to be renegotiated and supported as much as political ones do. (pp.183-185). Fourth: Delegation. The illustration here is the "sleeping policeman" or speed bump. "The driver's goal is translated, by means of the speed bump, from 'slow down as not to endanger students' into 'slow down and protect your car's suspension.' ... The driver's first version appeals to morality, enlightened interest, and reflection, wherea},

Approximately 9 million types of plants, animals, protists and fungi inhabit the Earth. So, too, do 7 billion people. Two decades ago, at the first Earth Summit, the vast majority of the world's nations declared that human actions were dismantling the Earth's ecosystems, eliminating genes, species and biological traits at an alarming rate. This observation led to the question of how such loss of biological diversity will alter the functioning of ecosystems and their ability to provide society with the goods and services needed to prosper.},

abstract = {This paper examines the effect of scale (exhibited by spatial sampling) in modeling mean slope from lidar data using two representations of scale: lidar posting density (i.e. post-spacing) and DEM resolution (i.e. cell size). The study areas selected include six small (i.e. approximately 3{\^{A}} km{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}) urban drainage basins in Richland County, SC, USA, which share similar hydrologic characteristics. This research spatially sampled an airborne lidar dataset collected in 2000 at a 2{\^{A}} m nominal posting density to simulate lidar posting density at various post-spacings, from 2{\^{A}} m through 10{\^{A}} m. DEMs were created from the lidar observations at a corresponding cell size using spatial interpolation. Finally, using these DEMs, a sensitivity analysis between modeled terrain slope and lidar post-spacing was conducted. Results of the sensitivity analyses showed that the deviation between mean slope and modeled mean slope decreases with finer posting density and DEM resolution. The relationship of mean slope with varying cell sizes and post-spacing suggests a linear and a logarithmic function, respectively, for all study areas. More importantly, cell size has a greater effect on mean slope than lidar posting density. Implications of these results for lumped hydrologic modeling are then postulated.},

Specifically, the author examines the processes by which ecologists understand and assess the quality of the data they reuse, and investigates the role that standard methods of data collection play in these processes. Standardization is one means by which scientific knowledge is transported from local to public spheres. While standards can be helpful, the results show that knowledge of the local context is critical to ecologists' reuse of data. Yet, this information is often left behind as data move from the private to the public world. The knowledge that ecologists acquire through fieldwork enables them to recover the local details that are so critical to their comprehension of data collected by others. Social processes also play a role in ecologists' efforts to judge the quality of data they reuse.},

@article{Willgoose1991a,
abstract = {This paper explores the scaling and similitude properties of the system of governing equations for a catchment evolution model that was presented in an accompanying paper (Willgoose et al., this issue). Similitude is an important concept that allows the quantification of the similarities of, and differences between, two catchments. Through the use of a small number of nondimensional numbers the governing physics of the channel network and surrounding hillslopes in a catchment may be summarized. These nondimensional numbers lead to similarity conditions that allow for the quantitative comparison of data between field catchments and between the field scale and the controlled experimental scale. Derived relationships are presented for the drainage density of the channel network and the rate at which the network grows, parameterized using the nondimensional numbers. Drainage density is shown to be mostly a function of the hillslope channel initiation number that relates the slopes and lengths of hillslopes in a very simple fashion. Finally, it is shown that the form of a channel network is very sensitive to initial conditions. Though the exact form of the network and the hillslopes may vary greatly, along with their topological statistics, physical statistics such as drainage density are only slightly affected.},

Prediction in this domain is usually limited less by our understanding of the physics or by the power of our models than by the availability of input data, such as bathymetry and wave conditions. It is a challenge for traditional in situ instruments to provide these inputs with the appropriate temporal or spatial density or at reasonable logistical or financial costs. Remote sensing provides an attractive alternative. We discuss the range of different sensors that are available and the differing physical manifestations of their interactions with the ocean surface. We then present existing algorithms by which the most important geophysical variables can be estimated from remote sensing measurements. Future directions and opportunities will depend on expected developments in sensors and platforms and on improving processing algorithms, including data assimilation formalisms.},

@article{Hall2012a,
abstract = {For the past 150 years, economics has been treated as a social science in which economies are modeled as a circular flow of income between producers and consumers. In this “perpetual motion” of interactions between firms that produce and households that consume, little or no accounting is given of the flow of energy and materials from the environment and back again. In the standard economic model, energy and matter are completely recycled in these transactions, and economic activity is seemingly exempt from the Second Law of Thermodynamics. As we enter the second half of the age of oil, and as energy supplies and the environmental impacts of energy production and consumption become major issues on the world stage, this exemption appears illusory at best. In Energy and the Wealth of Nations, concepts such as energy return on investment (EROI) provide powerful insights into the real balance sheets that drive our “petroleum economy.” Hall and Klitgaard explore the relation between energy and the wealth explosion of the 20th century, the failure of markets to recognize or efficiently allocate diminishing resources, the economic consequences of peak oil, the EROI for finding and exploiting new oil fields, and whether alternative energy technologies such as wind and solar power meet the minimum EROI requirements needed to run our society as we know it. This book is an essential read for all scientists and economists who have recognized the urgent need for a more scientific, unified approach to economics in an energy-constrained world, and serves as an ideal teaching text for the growing number of courses, such as the authors' own, on the role of energy in society.},

abstract = {A 3.8-ha watershed on the west coast of New Zealand was instrumented with suction lysimeters and automatic water samplers to determine the relationship between subsurface isotopic and chemical concentrations to those of rainfall and resulting streamflow. A t test showed that ±2‰ represented a significant difference between successive sample deuterium values. Eleven rainfall episodes were subdivided into two categories: (1) two events where stream isotopic composition did not deflect {\textgreater}2‰ from prestorm values, and (2) four events which demonstrated new water flushing. Detailed analysis of one 47-mm rainfall (9.8-mm runoff) event showed that old water dominated stream water exiting the watershed by 90{\%} using a standard two-component hydrograph separation for deuterium (corroborated by Cl and electrical conductivity). Three-component hydrograph separation indicated that 12–16{\%} was in the form of soil water, with {\textless}5{\%} as on-channel precipitation and 80{\%} groundwater. Analysis of over 1000 water samples revealed systematic trends in soil water and groundwater isotopic composition both in a downslope and downprofile direction. Between-storm suction lysimeter deuterium data showed a systematic dampened response to temporally variable rainfall deuterium concentrations. Multivariate cluster analysis revealed three distinct soil water/groundwater groupings, with respect to soil depth and geographic position within the watershed. Within-storm suction lysimeter sampling preserved similar groupings, indicating that the subsurface reservoir is poorly mixed on short time scales. Understanding subsurface mixing response to rainfall should greatly improve models of episodic stream response and partitioning of storm flow into waters of different age.},

Drawing upon land survey records and early travelers' accounts, Dr Whitney reconstructs the 'virgin' forests and grasslands of the northeastern and central United States during the presettlement period. He then documents successively the clearance and fragmentation of the region's woodlands, the harvest of the forest and its game, the ploughing of the prairies, and the draining of wetlands. The degree to which these activities altered the soil, climate, plant and animal communities, and water cycle are evaluated, and the sustainability of present-day ecosystems is brought into question in this unique account.},

@misc{Harvey1993b,
abstract = {A numerical hydrological simulation suggested that water exchange between stream channels and adjacent aquifers is enhanced by convexities and concavities in streambed topography. At St. Kevin Gulch, an effluent stream in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, subsurface hydraulic gradients and movement of ionic tracers indicated that stream water was locally recharged into well-defined flow paths through the alluvium. Stream water-filled paths in the alluvium (referred to as substream flow paths) returned to the stream a short distance downstream (1 to 10 m). Recharge to the substream flow paths occurred where stream water slope increased, at the transition from pools ({\textless}1$\backslash${\%}) to steeper channel units (5-20$\backslash${\%}). Return of substream flow paths to the stream occurred where stream water slow decreased, at the transition from steeper channel units to pools. A net water flux calculation is typically used to characterize water and solute fluxes between surface and subsurface zones of catchments. Along our study reach at St. Kevin Gulch the net inflow of water from subsurface to stream (1.6 m*L/s*m) underestimated the gross inflow (2.7 mL/s*m) by 40$\backslash${\%}. The influence of streambed topography is to enhance hydrological fluxes between stream water and subsurface zones and to prolong water-sediment contact times; these effects could have important consequences for solute transport, retention, and transformation in catchments. -Other},

Bacterial nitrification and denitrification are thought to be the primary sources of marine N2O, but the isotopic signatures of N2O produced by these processes are not consistent with the marine contribution to the global N2O budget. Based on enrichment cultures, we report that archaeal ammonia oxidation also produces N2O. Natural-abundance stable isotope measurements indicate that the produced N2O had bulk $\delta$15N and $\delta$18O values higher than observed for ammonia-oxidizing bacteria but similar to the $\delta$15N and $\delta$18O values attributed to the oceanic N2O source to the atmosphere. Our results suggest that ammonia-oxidizing archaea may be largely responsible for the oceanic N2O source.},

abstract = {An attempt at applying the digital image processing (DIP) technique to analyze the particle size distribution of coarse aggregate is made. Three different types of aggregates have been analyzed, and their grading curves are compared to those obtained by conventional mechanical sieving. Because DIP produces only area gradation and uses a particle size definition different from the square sieve size used in mechanical sieving, direct comparison is not possible unless the gradation basis and particle size definitions of the two methods are aligned. For this purpose, a simple method of converting the area gradation to mass gradation is proposed. Moreover, a size correction factor is used to convert the particle sizes measured by DIP to equivalent square sieve sizes so that comparison between the DIP and mechanical sieving results can be made. The study demonstrates that DIP is a fast, convenient, versatile, and accurate technique for particle size distribution analysis. It is, however, not without limitations, which will be discussed.},

abstract = {Southern Appalachian forests are recognized as a biodiversity hot spot of global significance, particularly for endemic aquatic salamanders and mussels. The dominant driver of land-cover and land-use change in this region is surface mining, with an ever-increasing proportion occurring as mountaintop mining with valley fill operations (MTVF). In MTVF, seams of coal are exposed using explosives, and the resulting noncoal overburden is pushed into adjacent valleys to facilitate coal extraction. To date, MTVF throughout the Appalachians have converted 1.1 million hectares of forest to surface mines and buried more than 2,000 km of stream channel beneath mining overburden. The impacts of these lost forests and buried streams are propagated throughout the river networks of the region as the resulting sediment and chemical pollutants are transmitted downstream. There is, to date, no evidence to suggest that the extensive chemical and hydrologic alterations of streams by MTVF can be offset or reversed by currently required reclamation and mitigation practices.},

abstract = {The covariation of carbon dioxide (CO(2)) concentration and temperature in Antarctic ice-core records suggests a close link between CO(2) and climate during the Pleistocene ice ages. The role and relative importance of CO(2) in producing these climate changes remains unclear, however, in part because the ice-core deuterium record reflects local rather than global temperature. Here we construct a record of global surface temperature from 80 proxy records and show that temperature is correlated with and generally lags CO(2) during the last (that is, the most recent) deglaciation. Differences between the respective temperature changes of the Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere parallel variations in the strength of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation recorded in marine sediments. These observations, together with transient global climate model simulations, support the conclusion that an antiphased hemispheric temperature response to ocean circulation changes superimposed on globally in-phase warming driven by increasing CO(2) concentrations is an explanation for much of the temperature change at the end of the most recent ice age.},

@article{Rehme2011,
abstract = {Ecology is an inherently complex science coping with correlated variables, nonlinear interactions and multiple scales of pattern and process, making it difficult for experiments to result in clear, strong inference. Natural resource managers, policy makers, and stakeholders rely on science to provide timely and accurate management recommendations. However, the time necessary to untangle the complexities of interactions within ecosystems is often far greater than the time available to make management decisions. One method of coping with this problem is multimodel inference. Multimodel inference assesses uncertainty by calculating likelihoods among multiple competing hypotheses, but multimodel inference results are often equivocal. Despite this, there may be pressure for ecologists to provide management recommendations regardless of the strength of their study's inference. We reviewed papers in the Journal of Wildlife Management (JWM) and the journal Conservation Biology (CB) to quantify the prevalence of multimodel inference approaches, the resulting inference (weak versus strong), and how authors dealt with the uncertainty. Thirty-eight percent and 14{\%}, respectively, of articles in the JWM and CB used multimodel inference approaches. Strong inference was rarely observed, with only 7{\%} of JWM and 20{\%} of CB articles resulting in strong inference. We found the majority of weak inference papers in both journals (59{\%}) gave specific management recommendations. Model selection uncertainty was ignored in most recommendations for management. We suggest that adaptive management is an ideal method to resolve uncertainty when research results in weak inference.},

abstract = {We studied the relationship between stream discharge and reproductive success for five members of a prairie stream fish assemblage. Based on information obtained from the literature, we constructed seven models relating stream discharge to successful reproduction. To assess the utility of our models, we collected larval and juvenile Arkansas River shiners Notropis girardi, peppered chub Macrhybopsis tetranema, plains minnow Hybognathus placitus, flathead chub Platygobio gracilis, and red shiners Cyprinella lutrensis from the Canadian River, Texas, during 2000–2001. We removed otoliths and counted daily growth increments to determine ages. Models were parameterized by use of age and discharge data. Models were evaluated with the Akaike information criterion likelihood statistic to assess which model(s) best described reproductive success for each species. Of the seven models evaluated, the best overall model predicted that reproductive success was uniform across dates when discharge was present in the river; however, reproduction was predicted to be unsuccessful during periods when the river was confined to isolated pools. These results suggest that the presence of discharge in the river may be more important for successful reproduction of prairie stream cyprinids than the magnitude of discharge.},

abstract = {Gross and net primary production have been measured at bi-weekly intervals for 18 months in the North-western Sargasso Sea 15 miles SE. of Bermuda in 1500 fm of water. Ancillary data include temperature, salinity, phosphate, nitrite, nitrate, disolved oxygen, plant pigments, light penetration and incident radiation. A seasonal cycle of production was observed with high levels in the winter and early spring, low levels in the later spring, summer and early fall. Gross production ranged from 0{\textperiodcentered}13 to 2{\textperiodcentered}00, averaging 0{\textperiodcentered}44 g carbon assimilated/m2/day or 160 g C/m2/year. Net production ranged from 0{\textperiodcentered}05 to 0{\textperiodcentered}83 and averaged 0{\textperiodcentered}20 g C/m2/day or 72 g C/m2/year. Production was closely dependent upon vertical mixing, high levels occuring when the water was isothermal and mixed to or near the depth of the permanent thermocline (400 m), low levels being associated with the presence of a seasonal thermocline in the upper 100 m. Nutrient concentrations were extremely low (maxima of 1{\textperiodcentered}8 $\mu$gAN/L and 0{\textperiodcentered}16 $\mu$g AP/L as inorganic compounds in the upper 100 m) and showed little seasonal variability. Mixing and enrichment from the permanent thermocline is negligible, production being largely dependent upon the rapid re-cycling of nutrients within the upper 400 m. The environmental factors controlling production which make this region differ from temperate or boreal waters, and which permit high production throughout the winter are: (1) low nutrient concentrations, (2) clear water, (3) relatively high incident radiation in winter, (4) a shallow winter mixed layer and (5) a rapid re-cycling of nutrients, possibly due to higher temperatures.},

abstract = {Remote imaging spectroscopy from 400 to 800 nm can use benthic reflectance signatures to map the composition and condition of shallow water ecosystems. We present a novel probabilistic approach to jointly estimate the seafloor reflectance and water properties while flexibly incorporating varied domain knowledge and in situ measurements. The inversion transforms remote radiance data with an atmospheric correction followed by a water column correction. Benthic reflectance and water optical properties are both represented by linear mixtures of endmember spectra. We combine remote measurements, prior knowledge and field data using a flexible Bayesian optimal estimation, solving for the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) combination of water column properties, seafloor reflectance, and depth. We then demonstrate performance in controlled simulations and in overflights of a coral reef in Hawaii with coincident in situ measurements. The measurement approach helps lay a foundation for wide-area airborne mapping of the condition of threatened coastal ecosystems such as coral reefs.},

abstract = {A thorough understanding of full waveform (FW) LiDAR data processing and associated uncertainty is critical to vegetation applications such as retrieving forest structure variables and estimating forest biomass. This paper applies the Bayesian non-linear modeling concept to process small-footprint FW LiDAR data (the Bayesian decomposition) collected at a study site of the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) to investigate its potential for waveform decomposition and uncertainty estimation. Specifically, several possible models suitable for fitting waveforms were assessed within the Bayesian framework, and the Gaussian model was selected to perform the Bayesian decomposition. Subsequently, we conducted performance evaluation and uncertainty analysis at the parameter, derived point cloud and surface model levels. Results of the model reasonableness show that the Gaussian model is superior to alternative models with respect to uncertainty, physical meaning and processing efficiency. After converting waveforms to discrete points, the model comparisons demonstrate that the Bayesian decomposition can be utilized for FW LiDAR data processing, and its results are comparable to the direct decomposition (DD), Gold and RL (Richardson–Lucy) approaches in terms of the root mean squared error (RMSE {\textless} 0.93 m) of the point distances between the waveform-based point cloud and the reference point cloud. Additionally, more points can be extracted from FW LiDAR data with these methods than discrete-return LiDAR data, especially at the mid-story of vegetation based on the results of height bins, percentile heights and canopy LiDAR density at the individual tree level. Moreover, uncertainty estimates from the Bayesian method enhance the credibility of decomposition results in a probabilistic sense to capture the true error of estimates and trace the uncertainty propagation along the processing steps. For example, results of the surface model yield larger RMSE values (1.38 m vs. 0.65 m) with a wider credible interval than quantile point clouds with a more compact distribution. In contrast to commonly used deterministic approaches, the Bayesian decomposition method can produce an ensemble of reasonable parameter estimates with probability through Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling from the posterior distribution of model parameters. These parameter estimates and corresponding derived products can be queried to provide meaningful interpretation of results and associated uncertainty. Both the flat priors and empirical priors can achieve good performance of the decomposition while the empirical priors tend to significantly speed up the model convergence. The Bayesian approach also renders an important insight into the uncertainty of the model performance evaluation using field data by generating reasonable prediction intervals to reduce inherent errors of field measurements.},

abstract = {It is said that Herbert Simon would have described himself as follows : «I am a monomaniac. What I am a monomaniac about is decision making ». In spite of its shares of legend and humour, this self-portrait deeply reflects the main logic of Herbert Simon's works. From his early papers on administrative behaviour to his last investigations on thought and learning, Simon kept a same goal : to explain complex and mysterious human behaviour by simple and constrained, yet informed, decision rules. « Bounded rationality » was the name he gave to a research orientation2 wich rejected the maximizing behaviour assumed by classic economics. But beyond this critical aim, Simon attempted to build an empirically grounded theory of human problem solving. A theory that was intended to settle the foundation stone of « behavioural economics ». Problem solving also soon became the key entry to what he labeled a « science of the artificial » or a « Science of Design ». This second program took growing importance in connection with his own involvement in Artificial intelligence and cognitive psychology. Here one can be grateful to Simon's outstanding shrewdness and insight. Although there is now an increased awareness to innovation and growth processes, still few economists would spontaneously think that a good theory of Design is important for their own discipline. Yet, Simon's attempts to develope a Design theory remain unfinished. I will discuss in this paper the two central reasons that support this point : i) Simon's always maintained that Design and creativity were special forms of problem solving while it is more likely that Decision making and problem solving are restricted forms of Design ; ii) Simon's limited interest for the construction of social interaction which is a key resource of design processes3. This discussion will allow me to introduce a concept of « expandable rationality » as a potential paradigm for design theory. To conclude, I will suggest that, in spite of human agents limitations in problem solving and decision},

abstract = {Over the last century, the river-dominated Mississippi delta has received increasing attention from geoscientists, biologists, engineers, and environmental planners because of the importance of the river and its deltaic environments to the economic well-being of the state of Louisiana and the nation. Population growth, subsurface resource extraction, and increased land-water use have placed demands on the delta's natural geologic, biologic, and chemical systems, therefore modifying the time and spatial scales of natural processes within the delta and its lower alluvial valley. As a result, the combined effects of natural and human-induced processes, such as subsidence, eustatic sea level rise, salt water intrusion, and wetland loss, have produced a dynamically changing landscape and socioeconomic framework for this complex delta. Under natural conditions, the fundamental changes that result in land-building and land loss in the Holocene Mississippi River delta plain are rooted in the systematic diversion of water and sediment associated with major shifts in the river's course-the process of delta switching. Research over the last half century has shown that major relocations of the Mississippi's course have resulted in five Holocene delta complexes and a sixth one in an early stage of development as a product of the latest Atchafalaya River diversion. Collectively, these Holocene deltas have produced a delta plain that covers an area of {\~{}}30,000 km2 and accounts for 41{\%} of the coastal wetlands in the United States. After a river diversion takes place, the resulting delta evolves through a systematic and semipredictable set of stages generally characterized by: (a) rapid progradation with increasing-to-stable discharge, (b) relative stability during initial stages of waning discharge, (c) abandonment by the river in favor of a higher gradient course to the receiving basin, and (d) marine reworking of a sediment-starved delta as it undergoes progressive submergence by the combined processes of subsidence. Delta switching has taken place every 1000 to 2000 years during Holocene times, and resulting deltas have an average thickness of approximately 35 m. Within a single delta there are subdeltas, bayfills, and crevasse-splays that have higher frequency delta cycles ranging from several hundred years to a few decades. These depositional features are usually less than 10 m thick, and some have produced marshland areas of over 300 km2. The net result of these delta-building events is a low-lying landscape with components that are changing (building and deteriorating) at different rates. Geologically, these depositional cycles produce a thick accumulation of coarsening, upward deltaic deposits that have various thicknesses in response to development on a variety of temporal and spatial scales. In this river-dominated delta system, distributaries can prograde seaward at rates of over 100 m/year. The cumulative effect of the Holocene depository has been to depress the underlying Pleistocene surface. In a local setting, e.g., the modern Balize Lobe, differential loading causes the vertical displacement of underlying clay-rich facies (shale diapirs-midlumps). The delta front of this lobe, which has prograded into deep water of the outer continental shelf, is characterized by rapid deposition of silt- and clay-rich sediments and slope instability, which results in seaward displacement of sediments by a variety of mass-movement processes. Superimposed on the natural processes and forms of the Mississippi deltaic plain and its associated estuarine environments, are human impacts, most of which have been imposed in this century. The most significant impacts have resulted from a decrease in sediment input to the river from its tributaries and the alteration of the river's natural sediment dispersal processes through the construction of levees. Measures are now being taken to reinstate some of the delta's natural processes, thereby mitigating landloss so that decline in animal and plant productivity can be mitigated.},

abstract = {This paper presents a multiple linear regression model developed for describing global river export of sediments (suspended solids, TSS) to coastal seas, and approaches for estimating organic carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorous transported as particulate matter (POC, PN, and PP) associated with sediments. The model, with river-basin spatial scale and a 1-year temporal scale, is based on five factors with a significant influence on TSS yields (the extent of marginal grassland and wetland rice, Fournier precipitation, Fournier slope, and lithology), and accounts for sediment trapping in reservoirs. The model generates predictions within a factor of 4 for 80{\%} of the 124 rivers in the data set. It is a robust model which was cross-validated by using training and validation sets of data, and validated against independent data. In addition, Monte Carlo simulations were used to deal with uncertainties in the model coefficients for the five model factors. The global river export of TSS calculated thus is 19 Pg yr-1 with a 95{\%} confidence interval of 11–27 Pg yr-1 when accounting for sediment trapping in regulated rivers. Associated POC, PN, and PP export is 197 Tg yr-1 (as C), 30 Tg yr-1 (N), and 9 Tg yr-1 (P), respectively. The global sediment trapping included in these estimates is 13{\%}. Most particulate nutrients are transported by rivers to the Pacific ({\~{}}37{\%} of global particulate nutrient export), Atlantic (28–29{\%}), and Indian ({\~{}}20{\%}) oceans, and the major source regions are Asia ({\~{}}50{\%} of global particulate nutrient export), South America ({\~{}}20{\%}), and Africa (12{\%}).},

abstract = {An assessment is made of contemporary effective sea-level rise (ESLR) for a sample of 40 deltas distributed worldwide. For any delta, ESLR is a net rate, defined by the combination of eustatic sea-level rise, the natural gross rate of fluvial sediment deposition and subsidence, and accelerated subsidence due to groundwater and hydrocarbon extraction. ESLR is estimated under present conditions using a digital data set of delta boundaries and a simple model of delta dynamics. The deltas in this study represent all major climate zones, levels of population density, and degrees of economic development. Collectively, the sampled deltas serve as the endpoint for river basins draining 30{\%} of the Earth's landmass, and 42{\%} of global terrestrial runoff. Nearly 300 million people inhabit these deltas. For the contemporary baseline, ESLR estimates range from 0.5 to 12.5 mm yr- 1. Decreased accretion of fluvial sediment resulting from upstream siltation of artificial impoundments and consumptive losses of runoff from irrigation are the primary determinants of ESLR in nearly 70{\%} of the deltas. Approximately 20{\%} of the deltas show accelerated subsidence, while only 12{\%} show eustatic sea-level rise as the predominant effect. Extrapolating contemporary rates of ESLR through 2050 reveals that 8.7 million people and 28,000 km2 of deltaic area in the sample set of deltas could suffer from enhanced inundation and increased coastal erosion. The population and area inundated rise significantly when considering increased flood risk due to storm surge. This study finds that direct anthropogenic effects determine ESLR in the majority of deltas studied, with a relatively less important role for eustatic sea-level rise. Serious challenges to human occupancy of deltaic regions worldwide are thus conveyed by factors which to date have been studied less comprehensively than the climate change-sea-level rise question. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {River deltas grow in response to sediment discharge from the land. It is not clear, however, whether or not there is a limit for such growth. Conceptual geometric models are used in this paper, in association with the principle of mass conservation, in an attempt to answer this question. Preliminary analyses of the Changjiang Delta indicate that delta growth is constrained by a number of factors: the original topography/bathymetry, sediment supply, sediment retention in the estuary, sea-level rise, ground subsidence. The quantity of sediment supply per unit area and the Sediment Retention Index for the subaqueous delta decrease as the delta progrades towards deeper water, resulting in a decreasing rate of growth. The limit of growth is reached when the index approaches zero, i.e. the shoreline reaches the shelf edge. If the combined effect of sea-level rise and ground subsidence is considered together with decrease in the sediment discharge from land, the limit is reached at an earlier stage. For the Changjiang Delta, the model output (using hypothesized Sediment Retention Index estimates) implies that the delta growth will reach its limit in the near future. This will occur sooner if the sediment output of the river is reduced to 60{\%} of its original level, in response to the upstream basin changes. Further knowledge, however, is required of the Retention Index, together with the information on future changes in river input and the character of the sediments in order to improve the accuracy of the simulations. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {An earlier investigation (Turner 1997) concluded that most of the coastal wetland loss in Louisiana was caused by the effects of canal dredging, that loss was near zero in the absence of canals, and that land loss had decreased to near zero by the late 1990s. This analysis was based on a 15-min quadrangle (approximately 68,000 ha) scale that is too large to isolate processes responsible for small-scale wetland loss and too small to capture those responsible for large-scale loss. We conducted a further evaluation of the relationship between direct loss due to canal dredging and all other loss from 1933-1990 using a spatial scale of 4,100 ha that accurately captures local land-loss processes. Regressions of other wetland loss on canal area (i. e., direct loss) for the Birdfoot, Terrebonne, and Calcasieu basins were not significant. Positive relationships were found for the Breton ( r2=0.675), Barataria ( r2=0.47), and Mermentau ( r2=0.35) basins, indicating that the extent of canals is significantly related to wetland loss in these basins. A significant negative relationship ( r2=0.36) was found for the Atchafalaya coastal basin which had statistically lower loss rates than the other basins as a whole. The Atchafalaya area receives direct inflow of about one third of the Mississippi discharge. When the data were combined for all basins, 9.2{\%} of the variation in other wetland loss was attributable to canals. All significant regressions intercepted the y-axis at positive loss values indicating that some loss occurred in the absence of canals. Wetland loss did not differ significantly from the coast inland or between marsh type. We agree with Turner that canals are an important agent in causing wetland loss in coastal Louisiana, but strongly disagree that they are responsible for the vast majority of this loss. We conclude that wetland loss in the Mississippi delta is an ongoing complex process involving several interacting factors and that efforts to create and restore Louisiana's coastal wetlands must emphasize riverine inputs of freshwater and sediments.},

abstract = {The daily variability of river suspended sediment concentration (Cs) and related yield (Y) is studied at 60 global stations. The data set covers natural conditions (e.g. pre-reservoir data), ranging from the humid tropics to subarctic and arid regions, located in all types of relief (yearly runoff q* from 0.1 to 55 l s-1 km-2). Basin area ranges from 64 km2 to 3.2 million km2. Survey lengths range from 1 to 20 years with a median of 3 years. Median values (Cs50, q 50, Y50) and discharge-weighted averages for Cs* and Y* range from 5 to 29 000 mg l-1 and 10 to 5000 kg km -2 day-1, respectively. A set of indicators of variability are proposed for sediment concentration, water and sediment discharges including mean to median ratios (Cs*/Cs50, Y*/Y50), the percentage of sediment flux discharged in 2{\%} of time (Ms2), the percentage of time necessary to carry half of the sediment flux (Ts50), and quantiles of Cs, q and Y distributions corresponding to the discharge-weighted averages. Since most of the sediment flux is discharged in less than 25{\%} of the time, "truncated rating curves" metrics are proposed between the Cs vs. q relationship for periods of high flux. Temporal variability decreases with increasing basin size, lake abundance, and is higher for basins influenced by glaciermelt and snowmelt. The least variable sediment flux regimes are noted for the Mississippi at its mouth, the Rhone Lacustre, the St. Lawrence and the Somme, a medium-sized French phreatic river. The most variable flux regimes were for small- to medium-sized basins (i.e. {\textless} 1000 to 10 000 km2) such as steep Andean Bolivian basins, Thai basins, the Eel (CA) and Walla Walla (OR) rivers. A proposed global scale typology is based on six classes key variability indicators. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Populations of native and introduced aquatic organisms in the San Francisco Bay/Sacramento- San Joaquin Delta Estuary ("Bay/Delta") have undergone significant declines over the past two decades. Decreased river inflow due to drought and increased freshwater diversion have contributed to the decline of at least some populations. Effective management of the estuary's biological resources requires a sensitive indicator of the response to freshwater inflow that has ecological significance, can be measured accurately and easily, and could be used as a "policy" variable to set standards for managing freshwater inflow. Positioning of the 2{\%}o (grams of salt per kilogram of seawater) bottom salinity value along the axis of the estuary was examined for this purpose. The 2{\%}o bottom salinity position (denoted by X2) has simple and significant statistical relationships with annual measures of many estuarine resources, including the supply of phytoplankton and phytoplankton-derived detritus from local production and river loading; benthic macroinvertebrates (molluscs); mysids and shrimp; larval fish survival; and the abundance of planktivorous, piscivorous, and bottom-foraging fish. The actual mechanisms are understood for only a few of these populations. X2 also satisfies other recognized requirements for a habitat indicator and probably can be measured with greater accuracy and precision than alternative habitat indicators such as net freshwater inflow into the estuary. The 2{\%}o value may not have special ecological significance for other estuaries (in the Bay/Delta, it marks the locations of an estuarine turbidity maximum and peaks in the abundance of several estuarine organisms), but the concept of using near-bottom isohaline position as a habitat indicator should be widely applicable. Although X2 is a sensitive index of the estuarine community's response to net freshwater inflow, other hydraulic features of the estuary also determine population abundances and resource levels. In particular, diversion of water for export from or consumption within the estuary can have a direct effect on population abundance independent of its effect on X2. The need to consider diversion, in addition to X2, for managing certain estuarine resources is illustrated using striped bass survival as an example. The striped bass survival data were also used to illustrate a related important point: incorporating additional explanatory variables may decrease the prediction error for a population or process, but it can increase the uncertainty in parameter estimates and management strategies based on these estimates. Even in cases where the uncertainty is currently too large to guide management decisions, an uncertainty analysis can identify the most practical direction for future data acquisition.},

abstract = {A marine hyperpycnal plume is a particular kind of turbidity current occurring at a river mouth when the concentration of suspended sediment is so large that the density of the river water is greater than the density of sea water. The plume can then plunge and possibly erode the seafloor to become self-maintained for a particular period of time (hours to weeks). Frequency of hyperpycnal plumes emanating from river discharge can be predicted with knowledge of rating curve characteristics, particularly during flood conditions. Examples of these curves are shown for middle-sized North American rivers. Semi-empirical relationships among average discharge, average sediment concentration, and the discharge during flood are proposed and applied to 150 world rivers. Results show the importance of small and medium sized rivers in their ability to trigger underflow at their mouth. There are at least nine "dirty" rivers that may trigger underflows during one or more periods of the year. Most other rivers are cleaner and have hyperpycnal plumes only during floods. Large rivers do not generate underflows at their mouth because sediment retention within their expansive coastal flood plains effectively reduces the upper limit of the suspended concentration. Underflow transport may be an important process in marine-delta construction and should be considered in sedimentary basinfill modeling. Proposed equations and nomograms may assist engineers in infrastructure design seaward of a river mouth.},

abstract = {Satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) has been used to assess population exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5). The emerging high-resolution satellite aerosol product, Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC), provides a valuable opportunity to characterize local-scale PM2.5 at 1-km resolution. However, non-random missing AOD due to cloud/snow cover or high surface reflectance makes this task challenging. Previous studies filled the data gap by spatially interpolating neighboring PM2.5 measurements or predictions. This strategy ignored the effect of cloud cover on aerosol loadings and has been shown to exhibit poor performance when monitoring stations are sparse or when there is seasonal large-scale missingness. Using the Yangtze River Delta of China as an example, we present a Multiple Imputation (MI) method that combines the MAIAC high-resolution satellite retrievals with chemical transport model (CTM) simulations to fill missing AOD. A two-stage statistical model driven by gap-filled AOD, meteorology and land use information was then fitted to estimate daily ground PM2.5 concentrations in 2013 and 2014 at 1km resolution with complete coverage in space and time. The daily MI models have an average R2 of 0.77, with an inter-quartile range of 0.71 to 0.82 across days. The overall model 10-fold cross-validation R2 (root mean square error) were 0.81 (25$\mu$g/m3) and 0.73 (18$\mu$g/m3) for year 2013 and 2014, respectively. Predictions with only observational AOD or only imputed AOD showed similar accuracy. Comparing with previous gap-filling methods, our MI method presented in this study performed better with higher coverage, higher accuracy, and the ability to fill missing PM2.5 predictions without ground PM2.5 measurements. This method can provide reliable PM2.5 predictions with complete coverage that can reduce bias in exposure assessment in air pollution and health studies.},

During the 2014–2015 austral summer, an exceptional situation was recorded by both the DOMEX ground radiometer and the European Space Agency (ESA)'s Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite. From November 2014 to March 2015, TB H showed a progressive and significant increase until 20 March 2015 when it sharply decreased by about 5K (at 52.5° incidence angle) within a few days. In parallel to the increase in TB H, glaciological and meteorological in situ measurements showed a wind speed that was lower than usual and a low-density snow layer being progressively set up on the surface. This was consistent with the exceptional hoar event observed, as well as with snow accumulation on the surface. On the other hand, the decrease in TB H was related to the passing over Dome C of a storm that removed or compacted the layer of light snow on the surface. The WALOMIS (Wave Approach for LOw-frequency MIcrowave emission in Snow) snow-emission model was used with in situ measurements of the snowpack as inputs for evaluating the effect of changes observed on the snow surface in TB H. The simulations indicated that the surface snow density variations were sufficient for predicting the increasing and decreasing trends of the TB H. However, the thickness variations of the superficial layer were essential so as to obtain a better agreement with the SMOS observations. This result confirmed that the L-band TB H was affected by the snow properties of the top centimeters of the snowpack, in spite of the large penetration depth (hundreds of meters). Both the surface snow density and the thickness of the superficial layer were relevant, due to coherent interference effects.},

Remotely sensing optical and radar data can help to map crop types and to estimate biophysical parameters, especially with the availability of an unprecedented amount of free Sentinel data within the Copernicus programme. These datasets, whose continuity is guaranteed up to decades, offer a unique opportunity to monitor crops systematically every 5 to 10days. Before developing operational monitoring methods, it is important to understand the temporal variations of the remote sensing signal of different crop types in a given region. In this study, we analyse the temporal trajectory of remote sensing data for a variety of winter and summer crops that are widely cultivated in the world (wheat, rapeseed, maize, soybean and sunflower). The test region is in southwest France, where Sentinel-1 data have been acquired since 2014. Because Sentinel-2 data were not available for this study, optical satellites similar to Sentinel-2 are used, mainly to derive NDVI, for a comparison between the temporal behaviors with radar data. The SAR backscatter and NDVI temporal profiles of fields with varied management practices and environmental conditions are interpreted physically. Key findings from this analysis, leading to possible applications of Sentinel-1 data, with or without the conjunction of Sentinel-2, are then described. This study points out the interest of SAR data and particularly the VH/VV ratio, which is poorly documented in previous studies.},

abstract = {Accuracy assessment of remote sensing soft (sub-pixel) classifications is a challenging topic. Previous efforts have focused on constructing a soft classification error matrix and producing summary measures to describe overall and per-class map accuracy. However, these summary assessments do not provide information on the spatial distribution of the soft classification error as distributed at the individual pixel level. This is important because the map error of a given class may vary considerably over different regions. Spatial interpolation has been previously used for predicting soft classification error at the pixel level. Here, we propose two alternative domains for soft classification error interpolation, the spectral and mapped class proportion domains. In the spectral domain we interpolate errors in the classification feature space, whereas in the mapped class proportion domain interpolation takes place in a space with dimensions defined by the mapped class proportions (i.e., the output of the soft classification). The two newly proposed prediction methods (spectral domain and mapped class proportion domain), spatial interpolation, and a summary measure method were evaluated using 23 test regions, each 10km×10km, distributed throughout the United States. These 10km×10km blocks had complete coverage reference data (where the reference classification was determined by manual interpretation) and the predicted error maps were then evaluated by comparing them to these complete coverage reference error maps. Mean absolute error was used to quantify the agreement of the predicted error maps to the reference error maps. The spectral and mapped class proportion methods generally outperformed the spatial interpolation and the summary measure methods both in terms of smaller mean absolute error and visual similarity of predicted error maps to the reference error maps. The superiority of the new methods over spatial interpolation is an important result because spatial interpolation is a familiar method analysts would commonly consider for modeling spatial variation of classification error. The predicted soft classification error maps provide a straightforward visual assessment of the spatial patterns of error that can accompany the original classification products to enhance their value in subsequent analysis and modeling tasks. Furthermore, from the standpoint of implementation, our methods do not require additional datasets; the same test dataset currently used for confusion/error matrix construction can be used for our error interpolation methods.},

However, in Alaskan boreal forest fires, their lower effectiveness in detecting residual fire once the high-intensity fire front has passed limits their practical use for regional or local fire management decisions. Using data acquired during Alaska's 2016 fire season, we analyzed the performance of the MODIS-based MOD14/MYD14, and the more recent VIIRS I-band active fire products. A comparison with the fire perimeter and properties data published by the Alaska Interagency Coordination Center (AICC) shows that both MODIS and VIIRS fire products successfully detect all fires larger than approximately 200–300ha. For fires smaller than this threshold, the VIIRS I-band product offers higher detection likelihood. To map burn areas containing both low- and high-intensity active fire, we developed the VIIRS I-band Fire Detection Algorithm for High Latitudes (VIFDAHL). We apply this algorithm to regions of known Alaskan boreal forest fires and validate it using events mapped by fire management agencies and detected on closely-timed Landsat imagery. We find that for Alaska, an example of a high-latitude region, VIFDAHL more accurately captures the fire spread, can differentiate well between low- and high-intensity fires, and can detect 30–90{\%} more fire pixels compared to the MODIS and VIIRS global fire products.},

abstract = {Large-scale crop monitoring and yield estimation are important for both scientific research and practical applications. Satellite remote sensing provides an effective means for regional and global cropland monitoring, particularly in data-sparse regions that lack reliable ground observations and reporting. The conventional approach of using visible and near-infrared based vegetation index (VI) observations has prevailed for decades since the onset of the global satellite era. However, other satellite data encompass diverse spectral ranges that may contain complementary information on crop growth and yield, but have been largely understudied and underused. Here we conducted one of the first attempts at synergizing multiple satellite data spanning a diverse spectral range, including visible, near-infrared, thermal and microwave, into one framework to estimate crop yield for the U.S. Corn Belt, one of the world's most important food baskets. Specifically, we included MODIS Enhanced VI (EVI), estimated Gross Primary Production based on GOME-2 solar-induced fluorescence (SIF-GPP), thermal-based ALEXI Evapotranspiration (ET), QuikSCAT Ku-band radar backscatter, and AMSR-E X-band passive microwave Vegetation Optical Depth (VOD) in this study, benchmarked on USDA county-level crop yield statistics. We used Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR), an effective statistical model for dimension reduction, to distinguish commonly shared and unique individual information from the various satellite data and other ancillary climate information for crop yield estimation. In the PLSR model that includes all of the satellite data and climate variables from 2007 to 2009, we assessed the first two major PLSR components and found that the first component (an integrated proxy of crop aboveground biomass) explained 82{\%} variability of modelled crop yield, and the second component (dominated by environmental stresses) explained 15{\%} variability of modelled crop yield. We found that most of the satellite derived metrics (e.g. SIF-GPP, radar backscatter, EVI, VOD, ALEXI-ET) share common information related to aboveground crop biomass (i.e. the first component). For this shared information, the SIF-GPP and backscatter data contain almost the same amount of information as EVI at the county scale. When removing the above shared component from all of the satellite data, we found that EVI and SIF-GPP do not provide much extra information; instead, Ku-band backscatter, thermal-based ALEXI-ET, and X-band VOD provide unique information on environmental stresses that improves overall crop yield predictive skill. In particular, Ku-band backscatter and associated differences between morning and afternoon overpasses contribute unique information on crop growth and environmental stress. Overall, using satellite data from various spectral bands significantly improves regional crop yield predictions. The additional use of ancillary climate data (e.g. precipitation and temperature) further improves model skill, in part because the crop reproductive stage related to harvest index is highly sensitive to environmental stresses but they are not fully captured by the satellite data used in our study. We conclude that using satellite data across various spectral ranges can improve monitoring of large-scale crop growth and yield beyond what can be achieved from individual sensors. These results also inform the synergistic use and development of current and next generation satellite missions, including NASA ECOSTRESS, SMAP, and OCO-2, for agricultural applications.},

With advanced technology in satellite observations as well as large-scale database development, it is possible for us to explore the large-scale effect of concurrent and lagged responses of terrestrial ecosystems to fire disturbances. In this study, we investigated the recovery of vegetation greenness in the early post-fire period in North America by integrating two national-level fire perimeter datasets and multiple Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products. We developed a new algorithm to estimate fire effect on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) by comparing fire pixels with their surrounding unburned pixels. Our results showed the fire effect on needleleaf trees was stronger than on other vegetation types, and the high-latitude ecoregions had larger NDVI reduction and longer recovery time than the mid-latitude ecoregions. We also found the variations in vegetation composition and fire severity can explain a large fraction of post-fire vegetation greenness recovery. Our satellite-based analysis showed a longer NDVI recovery time than the existing estimates, which indicates a stronger fire effect on ecosystems than previously thought. Findings in this study indicate that more sophisticated parameterization schemes of fire severity and post-fire vegetation recovery are needed for the vegetation-fire models to better simulate the terrestrial carbon cycling and climate-ecosystem feedbacks.},

abstract = {Satellite-based drought indices have been proved to be effective and convenient in detecting drought conditions at regional and global scales. However, most current drought indices are based on the visible/near infrared/thermal remote sensing, which might be influenced greatly by cloud, atmospheric water content and rain-fall. Microwave sensors can overcome the shortages of visible/near infrared/thermal remote sensing and show to be another important approach for drought monitoring due to its all-weather working advantages. But to date, the application of microwave vegetation drought indices in drought monitoring has not been thoroughly investigated. Here, for the first time we constructed a microwave derived Temperature Vegetation Drought Index (TVDI) - MTVDI based on the theory of optical TVDI using the brightness temperatures (Tb) from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR‐E) onboard Aqua satellite. Firstly, we built a new land surface temperature (Ts) inversion model based on the AMSR‐E 18.7GHz horizontal, 23.8GHz and 89.0GHz vertical polarized Tb, and then developed the Microwave Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (MNDVI) from the AMSR‐E 23.8GHz Microwave Polarization Difference Index (MPDI). After that, we constructed three versions of MTVDI: original MTVDI using Ts and MNDVI; Imp‐MTVDI (Improved MTVDI) using the Ts‐Tair (the difference between land surface temperature and air temperature) to replace the Ts; and NonL‐MTVDI (Nonlinear MTVDI) using nonlinear equation to fit the dry and wet edges, respectively. Finally, we used precipitation, soil moisture (SM) and P/PET (the ratio of precipitation to potential evapotranspiration) to validate the performances of MTVDI, Imp‐MTVDI, NonL‐MTVDI, MODIS derived TVDI and iTVDI (improved TVDI). The time-series drought assessments across China from 2003 to 2010 indicated that the trends of the proposed MTVDI showed the most negative correlations with the variations of precipitation, P/PET and SM, and showed best performances of significance test in most regions of China. Moreover, the MTVDI could better separate the drought levels in different degrees than MODIS-derived TVDI. However, the proposed MTVDI still has some uncertainties in regions widely covered by desert, Gobi and large water surfaces. In addition, this paper mainly focuses on large spatial scale and long term drought monitoring and only uses satellite data for model validation. Further studies are needed to develop a higher spatial- and temporal-resolution MTVDI for short-term and small spatial-scale drought monitoring.},

However, meteoric accumulation and redistribution of snow on first-year sea ice is highly stochastic over space and time, which makes it a poorly understood parameter. In this study, a region of late-winter snow thickness on first-year sea ice in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago is estimated using time series spaceborne C-band microwave scatterometer and optical MODIS data and a simple snow melt model. Results show good correspondence between the modeled snow thickness and remotely sensed dates of melt onset and pond onset. The mean snowmelt duration for 20 study sites is 24.6±1.2days, and the estimated mean snow thickness is 14.7±3.0cm. The overall performance of the model reveals a RMSE of 4.0cm and a mean bias of 0.3cm. The methodology shows promise; particularly because it can easily be scaled up in order to estimate snow thickness on seasonal sea ice on a regional basis.},

This paper explores the potential of X-band SAR data for forest height estimation over tropical Indian forests. Unique TanDEM-X data sets with varied spatial baselines are acquired over a tropical, deciduous Indian forest. Multiple dual polarimetric and fully polarimetric acquisitions are analysed and the best performance is achieved using fully polarimetric data acquired over both high- and low-biomass forests (r2=0.86andr2=0.80respectively). It is shown for the first time that, for deciduous Indian tropical forests, seasonal changes such as leaf-fall affect the PolInSAR based height inversion performance. For species exhibiting leaf-fall, acquisition during leaf-on season provides better height inversion accuracy (r2=0.75) than for leaf-fall season (r2=0.65). Results show consistent PolInSAR height inversion performance for both high- and low-biomass forests in both natural and managed forest tracts. Spatial baseline is a critical factor for selection of suitable acquisitions for PolInSAR based height estimation. The effect of spatial baseline on height inversion performance is also discussed.},

abstract = {Many applications require soil moisture estimates over large spatial extents (30–300km) and at fine-resolutions (10–30m). Remote-sensing methods can provide soil moisture estimates over very large spatial extents (continental to global) at coarse resolutions (10–40km), but their output must be downscaled to reach fine resolutions. When large spatial extents are considered, the downscaling procedure must consider multiple coarse-resolution grid cells, yet little attention has been given to the treatment of multiple grid cells. The objective of this paper is to compare the performance of different methods for addressing multiple coarse grid cells. To accomplish this goal, the Equilibrium Moisture from Topography, Vegetation, and Soil (EMT+VS) downscaling model is generalized to accept multiple coarse grid cells, and two methods for their treatment are implemented and compared. The first method (fixed window) is a direct extension of the original EMT+VS model and downscales each coarse grid cell independently. The second method (shifting window) replaces the coarse grid cell values with values that are calculated from windows that are centered on each fine grid cell. The window values are weighted averages of the coarse grid values within the window extent, and three weighting methods are considered (box, disk, and Gaussian). The methods are applied to three small catchments with detailed soil moisture observations and one large region. The fixed window typically provides more accurate estimates of soil moisture than the shifting window, but it produces abrupt changes in soil moisture at the coarse grid boundaries, which may be problematic for some applications. The three weighting methods produce similar results.},

Observations depict a two fold increase in surface and tropospheric ozone during the event as compared to normal days in both AIRS and TES ozone measurements. COSMIC temperature perturbations show generation of shorter vertical wavelengths efficient for the sub-tropical tropopause folding due to orography induced gravity waves. Moreover, the intense tropopause folding as evidenced by upward-downward vertical velocities couplet could trigger the intrusion of stratospheric ozone rich air into upper tropospheric ozone poor air as also confirmed by high values of potential vorticity during the observational period. Hence, present study reemphasizes the importance of wave induced atmospheric dynamics on atmospheric constituents' especially tropospheric ozone over Himalayan region.},

abstract = {Standard atmospheric correction (AC) algorithms work well in open ocean areas where the water inherent optical properties (IOPs) are correlated with pigmented particles. However, the IOPs of turbid coastal waters may independently vary with pigmented particles, suspended inorganic particles, and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM). In turbid coastal waters standard AC algorithms often exhibit large inaccuracies that may lead to negative water-leaving radiances (Lw) or remote sensing reflectance (Rrs). We introduce a new atmospheric correction algorithm for coastal waters based on a multilayer neural network (MLNN) method. We use a coupled atmosphere-ocean radiative transfer model to simulate the Rayleigh-corrected radiance (Lrc) at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) and the Rrs just above the surface simultaneously, and train a MLNN to derive the aerosol optical depth (AOD) and Rrs directly from the TOA Lrc. The method is validated using both a synthetic dataset and Aerosol Robotic Network – Ocean Color (AERONET–OC) measurements. The SeaDAS NIR algorithm, the SeaDAS NIR/SWIR algorithm, and the MODIS version of the Case 2 regional water - CoastColour (C2RCC) algorithm are also included in the comparison with AERONET–OC measurements. The performance of the AC algorithms is evaluated with four statistical metrics: the Pearson correlation coefficient (R), the average percentage difference (APD), the mean percentage bias, and the root mean square difference (RMSD). The comparison with AERONET–OC measurements shows that the MLNN algorithm significantly improves retrieval of normalized Lw in blue bands (412nm and 443nm) and yields minor improvements in green and red bands compared with the other three algorithms. On a global scale, the MLNN algorithm reduces APD in normalized Lw by up to 13{\%} in blue bands and by 2–7{\%} in green and red bands when compared with the standard SeaDAS NIR algorithm. In highly absorbing coastal waters, such as the Baltic Sea, the MLNN algorithm reduces APD in normalized Lw by more than 60{\%} in blue bands compared to the standard SeaDAS NIR algorithm, while in highly scattering coastal waters, such as the Black Sea, the MLNN algorithm reduces APD by more than 25{\%}. These results indicate that the MLNN algorithm is suitable for application in turbid coastal waters. Application of the MLNN algorithm to MODIS Aqua images in several coastal areas also shows that it is robust and resilient to contamination due to sunglint or adjacency effects of land and cloud edges. The MLNN algorithm is very fast once the neural network has been properly trained and is therefore suitable for operational use. A significant advantage of the MLNN algorithm is that it does not need SWIR bands.},

abstract = {Post-classification with multi-temporal remote sensing images is one of the most popular change detection methods, providing the detailed “from-to” change information in real applications. However, due to the fact that it neglects the temporal correlation between corresponding pixels in multi-temporal images, the post-classification approach usually suffers from an accumulation of misclassification errors. In order to solve this problem, previous studies have separated the change and non-change candidates with change vector analysis, and they have only updated the classes of the changed pixels with the post-classification; however, this approach with thresholding loses the continuous change intensity information, where larger values indicate higher probability to be changed. Therefore, in this paper, a new post-classification method with iterative slow feature analysis (ISFA) and Bayesian soft fusion is proposed to obtain reliable and accurate change detection maps. The proposed method consists of three main steps: 1) independent classification is implemented to obtain the class probability for each image; 2) the ISFA algorithm is used to obtain the continuous change probability map of multi-temporal images, where the value of each pixel indicates the probability to be changed; and 3) based on Bayesian theory, the a posteriori probabilities for the class combinations of coupled pixels are calculated to integrate the class probability with the change probability, which is named as Bayesian soft fusion. The class combination with the maximum a posteriori probability is then determined as the change detection result. In addition, a class probability filter is proposed to avoid the false alarms caused by the spectral variation within the same class. Two experiments with multi-temporal Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images indicated that the proposed method achieves a clearly higher change detection accuracy than the current state-of-the-art methods. The proposed method based on Bayesian theory and ISFA was also verified to have the ability to improve the change detection rate and reduce the false alarms at the same time. Given its effectiveness and flexibility, the proposed method could be widely applied in land-use/land-cover change detection and monitoring at a large scale.},

The products used have been developed by the Satellite Application Facility on Climate Monitoring (CM SAF) and are one geostationary climate dataset (SARAH-JRC), one polar-orbiting climate dataset (CLARA-A2) and one geostationary operational product. Further, the ERA-Interim reanalysis is also included in the comparison. The main objective is to determine the quality level of the daily means of CM SAF datasets, identifying their limitations, as well as analyzing the different factors that can interfere in the adequate validation of the products. The quality of the pyranometer was the most critical source of uncertainty identified. In this respect, the use of records from Second Class pyranometers and silicon-based photodiodes increased the absolute error and the bias, as well as the dispersion of both metrics, preventing an adequate validation of the daily means. The best spatial estimates for the three datasets were obtained in Central Europe with a Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) within 8–13W/m2, whereas the MAD always increased at high-latitudes, snow-covered surfaces, high mountain ranges and coastal areas. Overall, the SARAH-JRC's accuracy was demonstrated over a dense network of stations making it the most consistent dataset for climate monitoring applications. The operational dataset was comparable to SARAH-JRC in Central Europe, but lacked of the temporal stability of climate datasets, while CLARA-A2 did not achieve the same level of accuracy despite predictions obtained showed high uniformity with a small negative bias. The ERA-Interim reanalysis shows the by-far largest deviations from the surface reference measurements.},

Change in LULC can influence regional climate by altering the surface roughness, soil moisture, heat flux partition, and terrestrial carbon storage. Although annual global LULC maps are generated from Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, the earliest MODIS LULC map is for 2001, which limits the potential time period for climatological analyses. This study produced a continuous series of annual LULC maps of China from 1982 to 2013 using random forest classification of 19 phenological metrics derived from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) third generation NDVI (NDVI3g) data. The classifier was trained using reference data derived from the MODIS land cover type product (MCD12Q1). Based on a comparison with Google Earth images, the overall accuracy of a simplified eight-class version of our 2012 LULC map is 73.8{\%}, which is not significantly different from the accuracy of the MODIS map of the same year. Our maps indicate that for the three decades studied, the area of croplands and forests in China increased, and the area of grasslands decreased. These annual maps of land cover will be an important dataset for future climate studies, and the methodologies used in this study can be applied to other geographical regions where availability of continuous time series of LULC maps is limited.},

The first approach uses inflexion point of the vegetation growth curve to determine the start-of-season (SOS) and end-of-season (EOS), while the second approach identifies SOS and EOS with a predefined percentage of vegetation growth amplitude. These two approaches have long been thought to be independent. In this letter, we investigated the relationship between the two approaches for extracting SOS. It was found that the thresholds at several key points in the inflexion-based approach are constant. The threshold at the inflexion point for SOS and EOS is 9.18{\%} of vegetation growth amplitude. This threshold can link the SOS derived from the two approaches, which made it possible to determine the significant vegetation growth transitions for the threshold-based approach. Other thresholds for SOS retrieval, such as commonly-used 10{\%} and 20{\%} of vegetation growth amplitude, were also analyzed using a global reference NDVI. A high SOS difference between the two approaches indicates a slow vegetation growth.},

abstract = {Decomposition is an important biosphere process that recycles sequestered nutrients, plays a key role in carbon emissions, and accumulates compounds that exert negative feedbacks on primary production. In certain environments, litter comprises a considerable portion of the canopy, impeding the quantification of living biomass. Decomposition incurs physical changes and the genesis of decay pigments over time, causing the optical properties of litter to evolve in tandem. In order to simulate the spectral evolution of decaying leaves and relate the spectra to meaningful quantities of the biochemical compounds present, knowledge of the in-situ absorption properties of decay pigments is required. To determine the specific absorption coefficients of decay pigments in monocot leaf litter, we developed a spectral data set of multiple species at various decay stages concurrent with quantities of foliar compounds from fiber and humic acid analysis. Utilizing leaf humic acid content, the specific absorption coefficients for initial and advanced decay pigments were estimated using the PROSPECT model. For a 70-sample evaluation data set, simulated litter spectra closely matched the Reflectance, Transmittance, and Absorptance of measured leaves, with an average {\%}RMSE (400–2500nm range) of 4.95. Inversion of the expanded PROSPECT model had a moderate relationship between measured gravimetric humic acid content and the model inverted sum of initial and advanced decay pigments, as indicated by the R2=0.62 and index of agreement=0.72 goodness of fit statistics. Integrating the specific absorption coefficients of decay pigments into the PROSAIL model permitted the canopy reflectance of grassland scenes of intertwined photosynthetic leaves and litter to be simulated. Model inversion results aligned well with changes in canopy chlorophyll and biomass, cumulating in an R2=0.69 between measured and predicted leaf area index. Sensitivity analysis further revealed that canopy level reflectance in the near infrared region for mixed green vegetation and litter scenes are driven mainly by advanced decay pigments. Hence, the inclusion of decay pigments' specific absorption coefficients are of high importance for accurate simulation of mixed vegetation scenes. Further, the derived specific absorption coefficients can be utilized to quantify humic acid content in monocotyledon leaves as a proxy for decay stage and the carbon quality of litter.},

(2010), for soil moisture retrieval over agricultural fields covered by several crops. The volume scattering component was first removed from the full coherency matrix. Then, in order to reduce the effect of the incidence angle on the retrieval results, a normalization process at a reference incidence angle was conducted for the first time, on the dominant surface or dihedral scattering component from which the soil moisture was retrieved. The time series of Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) data and the ground measurements of soil and vegetation characteristics collected during the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) Validation Experiment in 2012 (SMAPVEX12) were used to compare the three decomposition methods with respect to the scattering mechanisms and the soil moisture retrieval performances. The results show that the performance of each decomposition method for soil moisture retrieval depends on the crop types and the crop phenological stages. Indeed, Freeman-Durden model provided the best results for corn and wheat, Hajnsek decomposition performed well for canola, while better results were obtained for soybean using An decomposition. At the early growth stage, both the surface and dihedral scattering components contributed to retrieve the soil moisture, while at a later crop development, the surface scattering component is almost the only scattering mechanism from which soil moisture was retrieved. Thus, the best performance for soil moisture retrieval was obtained a) at the early crop development stage from Hajnsek decomposition which better integrated the dihedral component and b) at a later growth stage from An decomposition which enhanced the surface scattering. Finally, an overall soil moisture underestimation with RMSE of 0.06–0.11m3/m3 was observed from the three decompositions, and the highest retrieval rate of 33{\%}–39{\%} was obtained from An decomposition as a result of the enhanced surface scattering.},

The MFmask algorithm, built upon the success of the Fmask algorithm (Zhu and Woodcock, 2012; Zhu et al., 2015), is designed for cloud and cloud shadow detection in mountainous areas, where the Fmask algorithm is not performing well. The inputs of the MFmask algorithm include Landsat Top of Atmosphere (TOA) reflectance, Brightness Temperature (BT), and Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). Compared to Fmask, MFmask can separate water and land pixels better in mountainous areas with the aid of DEMs. Moreover, MFmask produces better cloud detection results than Fmask in mountainous areas after BT is linearly normalized by DEMs. To provide more accurate cloud shadow detection in mountainous areas, MFmask uses a double-projection approach to better predict cloud shadow shape on slope side. Additionally, MFmask applies a topographic correction to remove terrain shadows and estimates cloud base height with neighboring clouds. Both will reduce the possibility of cloud and cloud shadow mismatch and increase cloud shadow detection accuracy for places with large topographic gradient. To test the performance of the proposed MFmask algorithm, a total of 67 Landsat images acquired in mountainous areas from different parts of the world were selected for assessing the accuracy of cloud detection, in which 15 of them were used for assessing the accuracy of cloud shadow detection. Compared with Fmask, MFmask can provide substantial improvements in cloud and cloud shadow detection accuracies for places with large topographic gradient and also work well for relatively flat terrain.},

The bulk NO3−-N deposition shows a clear seasonal variation, with high depositions occurring in the warm season (March–November) and peaking in July and August, and low bulk NO3−-N deposition appearing in winter (December–February). This study proves for the first time that the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) HNO3 and NO3− columns and precipitation are powerful to predict the bulk nitrate deposition.},

abstract = {Arctic environments provide a challenging ground for geological mapping and mineral exploration. Inaccessibility complicates ground surveys and the presence of ice, vegetation, and lichens hinders supportive remote sensing surveys. Spectral mixing of lichens and bare rock can shift the wavelength position of characteristic absorption features, thereby complicating the spectral mapping of minerals and lithologies. The extent to which diagnostic rock features are preserved despite the presence of lichens is of major concern in remotely sensed geological studies and estimates of the critical level of lichen coverage, below which spectral features of the mineral substrate can still be identified, are needed. We investigated how surficial lichen cover affects the characteristics of shortwave infrared (SWIR) mineral absorption features and the efficacy of automated absorption feature extraction. For this purpose, mixed spectra were synthetically generated from laboratory spectra of common rock forming SWIR absorbing minerals and lichens. Wavelength displacements of characteristic absorption features for each mixed spectrum were then analyzed as a function of percentage lichen cover. Distinctive trends were identified that can be used in future analysis: The strong spectral features of mica group minerals around 2200 and 2340–2350nm maintain their integrity for up to 30{\%} lichen cover, despite the related shift toward shorter wavelengths for higher percentage lichen cover. In contrast, very weak absorption bands around 2440nm in (white) micas spectra are completely obscured for a lichen cover of ≥50{\%}. Our observations suggest that the chlorite feature around 2250nm is shifted toward longer wavelengths and the depth of this feature as well as the contrast between lichen and substrate spectra define the amount of lichen needed to mask it. Furthermore, lichens induce a spectral shift towards shorter wavelengths for the features around 2320nm for the rocks containing amphibole, chlorite, carbonate and serpentine group minerals. In addition, no wavelength displacement is observed for chlorite, biotite and phlogopite features around 2380nm in mixtures with lichens. By quantifying lichen cover effects on mineral absorption features, our study highlights the importance of being precautious in any interpretation in areas characterized by abundant lichen-covered outcrops. This can be of significant importance for mineral and deposit vectoring as the presence of abundant lichen coverage causing slightly shifted features for a given spectra can be erroneously identified as a path to a deposit.},

abstract = {Roughness effect parameterization is critical to accurately simulate brightness temperature (Tb) signals observed by a radiometer over bare soil surface. However, current roughness parameterization schemes usually suffer from severe error, which dominates the error budget in current Tb modeling over bare soil surface. In this study, uncertainty of soil roughness parameterization schemes is comprehensively assessed using data set collected during 2004 to 2006 at the Surface Monitoring Of the Soil Reservoir Experiment (SMOSREX) bare soil experimental site. To reduce uncertainty from sampling depth mismatch, the soil moisture profile with a 1cm thickness from a calibrated Hydus-1D (H1D) model is utilized to determine the optimal soil moisture inputs to soil emission model. Uncertainties of 15 literature-based roughness effect parameterization schemes developed for L-band Tb modeling are inter-compared. The “Q/H” model is further calibrated against multi-angle and dual-polarization Tb observations at the SMOSREX bare soil site under different roughness conditions. Our results show that: (1) soil moisture sampling depth varies with soil moisture content and roughness condition. When soil is drier and rougher, the soil moisture sampling depth gets deeper. (2) The 15 roughness schemes generally perform better at vertical polarization than at horizontal polarization and better when soil surface is relative smooth than when soil surface gets rougher. The 15 roughness correction schemes have their own advantages and disadvantages with diverse error and bias characteristics. None of them has a superior performance at all conditions in terms of roughness, polarizations and incident angles. (3) A non-zero Q configuration is preferred in parameter retrieval experiments and the observed linear relationship between $\Delta$N and root-mean-square height ($\sigma$) or $\sigma$2/LC can only be reproduced when Q is non-zero in parameter retrieval. (4) The effective roughness parameters (Q, Np and h) generally increase when soil get rougher. The calibrated Q, Nh and Nv show exponential dependence on the effective parameter h. The calibrated h still shows dependence on surface soil moisture after accounting the impact from soil sampling depth and also shows strong power-law dependence on Tb at incident angle of 40°. The non-zero-Q fitting models have comparable performance in Tb modeling with zero-Q models but may be more physically realistic.},

abstract = {Models of animal density often use coarse landcover categories that homogenize vegetation attributes, thereby limiting specificity of results. Alternatively, models including land surface phenology (LSP) metrics derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite imagery capture continuous time-series data describing plant growth and senescence. LSP metrics may better discriminate the vegetation conditions influencing species habitat and distribution. Additionally, applications modeling animal density often use clusters (i.e., groups of individuals) but omit differences in cluster sizes. Ignoring how cluster size varies with landscape characteristics risks misrepresenting the spatial distribution of an animals' density. Using lesser prairie-chickens (LEPC; Tympanuchus pallidicinctus) as an example, we integrated the spatial distributions of cluster density and cluster size with LSP metrics to better predict its density in Texas, USA. We modeled LEPC cluster density using hierarchical distance sampling and cluster size with zero-truncated generalized linear modeling. Variables included landcover categories, LSP metrics, human infrastructure and topography. Models incorporating LSP metrics received most support and identified conservation areas that landcover models missed. Cluster density associated with LSP metrics, road density, oil and gas well density, topography, and grassland to shrubland ratio. Cluster size associated with topography and LSP metrics. Omitting the spatial distribution of cluster size underestimated LEPC density. Our approach generates geospatial predictions for prioritizing LEPC protection, habitat restoration, and evaluating impacts from development or phenological change. This study demonstrates the utility of integrating LSP metrics, cluster density and cluster size for predicting species density across large and heterogeneous landscapes.},

abstract = {The Sentinel-2A multi-spectral instrument (MSI) acquires multi-spectral reflective wavelength observations with directional effects due to surface reflectance anisotropy and changes in the solar and viewing geometry. Directional effects were examined by considering two ten day periods of Sentinel-2A data acquired close to the solar principal and orthogonal planes over approximately 20°×10° of southern Africa. More than 6.6 million (January 2016) and 10.6 million (April 2016) pairs of reflectance observations sensed 3 or 7days apart in the forward and backscatter directions in overlapping Sentinel-2A orbit swaths were considered. The Sentinel-2A data were projected into the MODIS sinusoidal projection but first had to be registered due to a misregistration issue evident in the overlapping orbits. The top of atmosphere reflectance data were corrected to surface reflectance using the SEN2COR atmospheric correction software. Only pairs of forward and backward reflectance values that were cloud and snow-free, unsaturated, and had no significant change in their 3 or 7day separation, were considered. The maximum observed Sentinel-2A view zenith angle was 11.93°. Greater BRDF effects were apparent in the January data (acquired close to the solar principal plane) than the April data (acquired close to the orthogonal plane) and at higher view zenith angle. For the January data the average difference between the surface reflectance in the forward and backward scatter directions at the Sentinel-2A scan edges increased with wavelength from 0.035 (blue), 0.047 (green), 0.057 (red), 0.078 (NIR), to about 0.1 (SWIR). These differences may constitute a significant source of noise for certain applications. The suitability of a recently published methodology developed to generate Landsat nadir BRDF-adjusted reflectance (NBAR) was examined for Sentinel-2A application. The methodology uses fixed MODIS BRDF spectral parameters and is attractive because it has little sensitivity to the land cover type, condition, or surface disturbance and can be derived in a computationally efficient manner globally. It was applied to the southern Africa Sentinel-2A data and shown to reduce Sentinel-2A BRDF effects. The average difference between the reflectance in the forward and backward scatter directions at the Sentinel-2A scan edges was smaller in the NBAR data than in the corresponding surface reflectance data. Residual BRDF effects in the Sentinel-2A NBAR data occurred likely because of atmospheric correction and sensor calibration errors and inadequacies in the NBAR derivation approach. These issues are discussed with recommendations for future research including global and red-edge Sentinel-2A NBAR derivation that were not considered in this study.},

abstract = {The Mississippi River Delta is one of the most rapidly changing area on Earth, with large areas experiencing land loss and smaller areas experiencing loss. While some of the drivers of these changes are well known (high rates of relative sea level rise, reduced sediment inputs, canal dredging), debate exists about other drivers. One area that has received substantial attention is the role of, “river diversions,” areas where sediments and water are diverted from the Mississippi River into degrading wetlands with the hope of reinitiating deltaic land building processes. Some authors have argued that diversions lead to reduced shear strengths of wetland soils that make them more vulnerable to storm driven erosion, while other authors have argued that sediments from river diversions will develop stable land. This study examined this controversy in the Cubits Gap Subdelta, an analogue for a large ({\textgreater}1420m3s−1) river diversion by testing the hypothesis that areas of land gain, and/or resilience to erosion occurred in areas that actively received river sediments and as a result had mineral rich soils with high shear strength. To accomplish this, a Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) was developed for Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images. The NDWI was calculated from (Blue−SWIR)/(Blue+SWIR), where SWIR is the shorter wavelength, and yielded land/water boundary maps with 30m resolution. Results indicate that land gain occurred predominantly in the riverside section of this subdelta where sediments were imported from Mississippi River crevasses and/or dredging. Land loss typically occurred in the distal regions of the subdelta, which had lower levels of sediment supply and greater wave exposure. Sediment geotechnical analyses revealed land loss pixels generally correlated sediments with to high organic contents (9.0±1.9{\%}), water contents (54.8±3.7{\%}) and salinity (6.5±2.0PSU), with low shear strengths (5.7±0.8kNm−2) and low bulk density (0.6±0.8g cm−3), whereas land gain pixels generally correlate with low organic content (3.9±0.6{\%}), water content (38.1±4.2{\%}) high shear strength (10.9±4.1kNm−2) and bulk density (1.00±0.1gcm−3). This study suggests plans to restore the region by partially diverting the flow of the Mississippi River will be most successful if they carry high loads of sediment, and that concerns about the integrity of fresh marsh may be unwarranted if those marshes are sediment rich.},

abstract = {Ecosystem services of tidal wetlands depend upon hydrology and vegetation, which in turn vary with elevation differences on the order of centimeters. Variability on such a fine scale is not captured in digital elevation models prepared from conventionally acquired LiDAR data products that generally have a spatial resolution of 0.5–1.0m and vertical uncertainties up to 15cm. Until recently, capturing critical fine scale features required laborious, hands-on field surveys that took days to collect data and time limitations usually required surveys to be restricted to selected areas of a wetland. Using Structure-from-motion (SfM) photogrammetry and a small unmanned aerial vehicle, precise three-dimensional point clouds, digital surface models (DSM) and color orthomosaics were produced for three salt marshes in Eastern Canada. Vertical and horizontal measurements from the SfM photogrammetry compared favorably to those taken with a Differential Global Positioning System DGPS). Average horizontal displacements of 1.0–2.9cm were found across the three salt marshes with an average elevation difference of 2.7cm (±1.7cm) in comparison to DGPS. Analysis of the relationship of elevation between points taken with the DGPS and extracted from the SfM DSM gave an R2 of 0.99. With a ground sampling distance of 2.3cm our SfM photogrammetry generated models captured variations in topography associated with geomorphic features such as creeks, ponds, channel edges, and logs not visible in the DSM prepared from LiDAR of the same sites. SfM photogrammetry enables mapping of important hydrological features, such as creeks carrying drainage from upland watersheds or connectivity of ponds on the wetland surface. The former are important for transport of contaminants or diadromous fish, and the latter is important for resident fish, water birds, and mosquito larvae. Using SfM to distinguish vegetation structure that may indicate vegetation composition will enable more informed analyses of elevational controls on plant distribution and better prediction of their fate with sea level rise.},

abstract = {Elevation is a key environmental factor influencing both biological and ecological phenomena in mountain environments. Mountains are useful areas for studying impacts associated with climatic change, as their significant biological diversity often varies in conjunction with elevation. While previous studies have used remote sensing to quantify the impacts of elevation differences on land surface phenology descriptors in mountains, they have focused almost exclusively on the Northern Hemisphere. This study fills this gap by presenting a 15-year phenological time-series for the Australian Alps derived using data from the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Phenological descriptors were estimated from the MODIS time-series and they corresponded with the start, end and duration of the growing period (SGP, EGP and DGP, respectively) for the major vegetation communities in the Australian Alps. Results indicated that the descriptor corresponding with the start of the growing period was more sensitive to changes in elevation, while the results for the end of the growing period descriptor were more uniform, particularly at lower elevations. For all but the highest elevation areas in the Australian Alps, the results indicated an overall trend towards an earlier start and later end to the growing period, culminating in a longer duration of the growing period. These findings are consistent with those previously reported in the literature, though they are likely influenced by the fire history of the alpine areas.,},

Thereby the intensification of weathering due to climate change could have contributed to a small extent to the trend in terrestrial carbon uptake since the pre–Industrial Period.

The idea that weathering fluxes have increased globally over the Cenozoic in response to the Himalayan uplift is critically examined. It is shown that such an increase of global weathering, postulated to explain the sharp increase in the Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio, is not compatible with the carbon isotopic record, if the budgets of carbon, alkalinity and strontium are considered simultaneously. Another scenario of the Cenozoic evolution of global weathering consistent with the carbon isotopic record is proposed in which the global weathering flux varies only slightly over the Cenozoic with a small increase between 15 Ma and the present. This second scenario appears more consistent with the reconstructed carbonate sedimentation rate and the evolution of the carbon isotopic fractionation in continental and oceanic environments.},

Our 42 study sites encompass widely varying climatic and erosional regimes, with mean annual temperatures ranging from 2 to 25 ??C, average precipitation ranging from 22 to 420 cm??year-1, and denudation rates ranging from 23 to 755 t??km-2??year-1. Long-term chemical weathering rates range from 0 to 173 t??km-2 year-1, in several cases exceeding the highest granitic weathering rates on record from previous work. Chemical weathering rates are highest at the sites with rapid denudation rates, consistent with strong coupling between rates of chemical weathering and mineral supply from breakdown of rock. A simple empirical relationship based on temperature, precipitation and long-term denudation rates explains 89-95{\%} of the variation in long-term weathering rates across our network of sites. Our analysis shows that, for a given precipitation and temperature, chemical weathering rates increase proportionally with fresh-material supply rates. We refer to this as "supply-limited" weathering, in which fresh material is chemically depleted to roughly the same degree, regardless of its rate of supply from breakdown of rock. The temperature sensitivity of chemical weathering rates is two to four times smaller than what one would expect from laboratory measurements of activation energies for feldspar weathering and previous inter-comparisons of catchment mass-balance data from the field. Our results suggest that climate change feedbacks between temperature and silicate weathering rates may be weaker than previously thought, at least in actively eroding, unglaciated terrain similar to our study sites. To the extent that chemical weathering rates are supply-limited in mountainous landscapes, factors that regulate rates of mineral supply from erosion, such as tectonic uplift, may lead to significant fluctuations in global climate over the long term. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The magnitude of the dissolved silica export from large glacial areas such as the Greenland Ice Sheet is presently poorly quantified and not accounted for in global budgets. Here we present data from two fjord systems adjacent to the Greenland Ice Sheet which reveal a large export of dissolved silica by glacial meltwater relative to other macronutrients. Upscaled to the entire Greenland Ice Sheet, the export of dissolved silica equals 22 ± 10 Gmol Si yr-1. When the silicate-rich meltwater mixes with upwelled deep water, either inside or outside Greenland's fjords, primary production takes place at increased silicate to nitrate ratios. This likely stimulates the growth of diatoms relative to other phytoplankton groups.},

abstract = {The role of lacustrine systems in the global carbon cycle is a major topic in freshwater research. Most lakes release inorganic carbon to the atmosphere owing to the imbalance of net metabolism toward respiration. Most research on this topic relies on data collected in natural low-alkalinity lakes, and it therefore remains unclear what role human-made calcareous lakes play in the current paradigm. In this study, we reported inorganic carbon fluxes and net ecosystem production in a calcareous human-made reservoir in Spain using mass balances of inorganic carbon and dissolved oxygen. The inorganic carbon loadings reported are among the largest found in the literature, and the inorganic carbon pool in the reservoir depends on the net hydrological balance. The reservoir was identified as a net emitter of carbon dioxide (CO2) and showed persistent net heterotrophy, although we could not find any clear dependence of CO2 emissions on the metabolic balance. The variability of inorganic carbon and the net ecosystem production were poorly correlated, suggesting that additional internal processes govern the transformation of the dissolved inorganic carbon in the water column. Considering the significant decrease in surface alkalinity occurring during the summer, carbonate precipitation may be the dominant process confounding the relationship between metabolism and inorganic carbon variability. These results indicate that the CO2 dynamics may be weakly coupled to net metabolism in calcareous systems and that net heterotrophy may occur simultaneously with eutrophic conditions and low dissolved organic carbon concentration in flushed systems such as reservoirs.},

abstract = {Riverine iron (Fe) derived from glacial weathering is a critical micronutrient source to ecosystems of the Gulf of Alaska (GoA). Here we demonstrate that the source and chemical nature of riverine Fe input to the GoA could change dramatically due to the widespread watershed deglaciation that is underway. We examine Fe size partitioning, speciation, and isotopic composition in tributaries of the Copper River which exemplify a long-term GoA watershed evolution from one strongly influenced by glacial weathering to a boreal-forested watershed. Iron fluxes from glacierized tributaries bear high suspended sediment and colloidal Fe loads of mixed valence silicate species, with low concentrations of dissolved Fe and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Iron isotopic composition is indicative of mechanical weathering as the Fe source. Conversely, Fe fluxes from boreal-forested systems have higher dissolved Fe concentrations corresponding to higher DOC concentrations. Iron colloids and suspended sediment consist of Fe (hydr)oxides and organic complexes. These watersheds have an iron isotopic composition indicative of an internal chemical processing source. We predict that as the GoA watershed evolves due to deglaciation, so will the source, flux, and chemical nature of riverine Fe loads, which could have significant ramifications for Alaskan marine and freshwater ecosystems.

abstract = {Investigating the interplay between continental weathering and erosion, climate, and atmospheric CO2 concentrations is significant in understanding the mechanisms that force the Cenozoic global cooling and predicting the future climatic and environmental response to increasing temperature and CO2 levels. The Miocene represents an ideal test case as it encompasses two distinct extreme climate periods, the Miocene Climatic Optimum (MCO) with the warmest time since 35 Ma in Earth's history and the transition to the Late Cenozoic icehouse mode with the establishment of the east Antarctic ice sheet. However the precise role of continental weathering during this period of major climate change is poorly understood. Here we show changes in the rates of Miocene continental chemical weathering and physical erosion, which we tracked using the chemical index of alteration (CIA) and mass accumulation rate (MAR) respectively from Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Site 1146 and 1148 in the South China Sea.We found significantly increased CIAvalues and terrigenous MARs during the MCO (ca. 17–15 Ma) compared to earlier and later periods suggests extreme continental weathering and erosion at that time. Similar high rates were revealed in the early-middle Miocene of Asia, the European Alps, and offshore Angola. This suggests that rapid sedimentation during the MCO was a global erosion event triggered by climate rather than regional tectonic activity. The close coherence of our records with high temperature, strong precipitation, increased burial of organic carbon and elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration during the MCO argues for long-term, close coupling between continental silicate weathering, erosion, climate and atmospheric CO2 during the Miocene.},

abstract = {An analysis of the energy return on investment (EROI) of natural gas obtained from horizontal, hydraulically fractured wells in the Marcellus Shale was conducted using net external energy ratio methodology and available data and estimates of energy inputs and outputs. Used as sources of input data were estimates of carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides emitted from the gas extraction processes, as well as fuel-use reports from industry and other sources. Estimates of quantities of materials used and the associated embodied energy as well as other energy-using steps were also developed from available data. Total input energy was compared with the energy expected to be made available to end users of the natural gas produced from a typical Marcellus well. The analysis indicates that the EROI of a typical well is likely between 64:1 and 112:1, with a mean of approximately 85:1. This range assumes an estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) of 3.0 billion cubic feet (Bcf) per well. EROI values are directly proportionate to EUR values. If the EUR is greater or lesser than 3 Bcf, the EROI would be proportionately higher or lower. EROI is also sensitive to the energy used or embedded in gathering and transmission pipelines and associated infrastructure and energy used for their construction, energy consumed in well drilling and well completion, and energy used for wastewater treatment.

abstract = {A theoretical examination of the fracturing of rocks by means of pressure applied in boreholes leads to the conclusion that, regardless of whether the fracturing fluid is of the penetrating or nonpenetrating type, the fractures produced should be approximately perpendicular to the axis of least stress. The general state of stress underground is that in which the three principal stresses are unequal. For tectonically relaxed areas characterized by normal faulting, the least stress should be horizontal; the fractures produced should be vertical, and the injection pressure should be less than that of the overburden. In areas of active tectonic compression, the least stress should be vertical and equal to the pressure of the overburden; the fractures should be horizontal, and injection pressures should be equal to, or greater than, the pressure of the overburden. Horizontal fractures cannot be produced by hydraulic pressures less than the total pressure of the overburden. These conclusions are compatible with field experience in fracturing and with the results of laboratory experimentation.},

Process modules are developed and integrated into a life cycle model-GHOST (GreenHouse gas emissions of current Oil Sands Technologies) developed in prior work. Recovery and extraction of bitumen through surface mining and in situ processes result in 3-9 and 9-16 g CO(2)eq/MJ bitumen, respectively; upgrading emissions are an additional 6-17 g CO(2)eq/MJ synthetic crude oil (SCO) (all results are on a HHV basis). Although a high degree of variability exists in well-to-wheel emissions due to differences in technologies employed, operating conditions, and product characteristics, the surface mining dilbit and the in situ SCO pathways have the lowest and highest emissions, 88 and 120 g CO(2)eq/MJ reformulated gasoline. Through the use of improved data obtained from operating oil sands projects, we present ranges of emissions that overlap with emissions in literature for conventional crude oil. An increased focus is recommended in policy discussions on understanding interproject variability of emissions of both oil sands and conventional crudes, as this has not been adequately represented in previous studies.},

In addition, roads have a major role in opening up forested tropical regions to destructive colonization and exploitation. Here, we synthesize existing research on the impacts of roads and other linear clearings on tropical rainforests, and assert that such impacts are often qualitatively and quantitatively different in tropical forests than in other ecosystems.

abstract = {At first 'sustainable mining' could be perceived as a paradox-minerals are widely held to be finite resources with rising consumption causing pressure on known resources. The true sustainability of mineral resources, however, is a much more complex picture and involves exploration, technology, economics, social and environmental issues, and advancing scientific knowledge-predicting future sustainability is therefore not a simple task. This paper presents the results from a landmark study on historical trends in Australian mining, including ore milled, ore grades, open cut versus underground mining, overburden/waste rock and economic resources. When complete data sets are compiled for specific metals, particular issues stand out with respect to sustainability-technological breakthroughs (e.g. flotation, carbon-in-pulp), new discoveries (e.g. uranium or U), price changes (e.g. Au, boom/bust cycles), social issues (e.g. strikes), etc. All of these issues are of prime importance in moving towards a semi-quantitative sustainability model of mineral resources and the mining industry. For the future, critical issues will continue to be declining ore grades (also ore quality and impurities), increased waste rock and associated liabilities, known economic resources, potential breakthrough technologies, and broader environmental constraints (e.g. carbon costs, water). For this latter area, many companies now report annually on sustainability performance-facilitating analysis of environmental sustainability with respect to production performance. By linking these two commonly disparate aspects-mining production and environmental/sustainability data-it becomes possible to better understand environmental sustainability and predict future constraints such as water requirements, greenhouse emissions, energy and reagent inputs, and the like. This paper will therefore present a range of fundamental data and issues which help towards quantifying the resource and environmental sustainability of mining-with critical implications for the mining industry and society as a whole. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The mining of gold has been and continues to be an important aspect of Australian industry. Gold mining moved quickly from fossicking and alluvial sources in the 1850's to hard rock mining. This paper presents, arguably for the first time, a detailed historical compilation of Australian gold mining production data. This data is then analysed in the context of sustainability, focussing particularly on mineral resource sustainability and the broader aspects of environmental impacts now commonly reported by some mining companies in annual sustainability performance reports. The key trends which are demonstrated by the data include a long-term decline in ore grade, increased open cut mining, substantive increases in tailings and waste rock production, as well as showing the impact of new technologies and economics on available gold resources. The available environmental data on material and energy inputs to and pollutant emissions from gold production is also presented, showing a clear sensitivity to ore grade. In terms of sustainability, these relationships raise significant issues such as increasing greenhouse footprint per unit gold produced, potential impacts on energy and water consumption, as well as overall gold resource sustainability. The paper presents a unique case study of the resource and environmental sustainability of the Australian gold mining sector with major implications for sustainability policy and reporting. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Nickel (Ni) is an important metal in modern infrastructure and technology, with major uses in stainless steel, alloys, electroplating and rechargeable batteries. Economic Ni resources are found in either sulfide or laterite-type ores. Although the majority of economic resources are contained in laterite ores, the bulk of historic Ni production has been derived from sulfide ores since laterites require more complex processing. To meet future demand for Ni, there is an increasing amount of Ni being mined from laterite ores-leading to increasing energy and greenhouse gas emission costs for Ni production. In many of the major Ni fields of the world, environmental impacts have also been significant, especially in Sudbury in Canada and the Taimyr and Kola Peninsulas in Russia. A major gap in the literature remains on historical trends in global Ni mining, especially with respect to primary aspects such as production, known economic resources and ore grades and type. This paper compiles and analyses a wide array of data on global Ni mining, presenting a coherent picture of major historical trends and the current industry configuration. The paper includes unique historical data sets for major Ni fields, especially the Sudbury Basin and Thompson fields in Canada and the Kambalda field in Australia. By understanding these critical 'mega-trends' in the Ni industry, it is possible to better understand unfolding global issues, such as environmental impacts, greenhouse gas emissions, climate change and potential industry responses, and whether 'peak nickel' is a viable concept and the implications these issues have for Ni production and demand. The data, trends and issues synthesized in this paper therefore provide a compelling picture of the Ni industry, and should help to inform current research and policy directions. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {For the past 150 years, economics has been treated as a social science in which economies are modeled as a circular flow of income between producers and consumers. In this “perpetual motion” of interactions between firms that produce and households that consume, little or no accounting is given of the flow of energy and materials from the environment and back again. In the standard economic model, energy and matter are completely recycled in these transactions, and economic activity is seemingly exempt from the Second Law of Thermodynamics. As we enter the second half of the age of oil, and as energy supplies and the environmental impacts of energy production and consumption become major issues on the world stage, this exemption appears illusory at best. In Energy and the Wealth of Nations, concepts such as energy return on investment (EROI) provide powerful insights into the real balance sheets that drive our “petroleum economy.” Hall and Klitgaard explore the relation between energy and the wealth explosion of the 20th century, the failure of markets to recognize or efficiently allocate diminishing resources, the economic consequences of peak oil, the EROI for finding and exploiting new oil fields, and whether alternative energy technologies such as wind and solar power meet the minimum EROI requirements needed to run our society as we know it. This book is an essential read for all scientists and economists who have recognized the urgent need for a more scientific, unified approach to economics in an energy-constrained world, and serves as an ideal teaching text for the growing number of courses, such as the authors' own, on the role of energy in society.},

abstract = {Mining causes soil damage and destruction. In the process of removing the desired mineral material, original soils become lost, or buried by wastes. In many countries legislation now requires that surface soils be conserved and replaced, but there is a vast heritage of degraded land left by past mining that requires restoration. Since the industry that created this heritage has often gone and there is no money left, the restoration needs to be achieved as cheaply and yet as effectively as possible. The processes of natural succession demonstrate that nature can achieve restoration unaided, and develop fully functioning soils. Although there are problems set by the processes of dispersal, once they are established plants demonstrate that they can readily provide organic matter, lower soil bulk density, and bring mineral nutrients to the surface and accumulate them in an available form. Most importantly, some species can fix and accumulate nitrogen rapidly in sufficient quantities to provide a nitrogen capital, where none previously existed, more than adequate for normal ecosystem functioning. It will normally (but not always) be necessary to introduce artificially, the plant species most appropriate for the restoration process. But natural ecosystem development can then be left to occur on its own. In mined lands, however, certain extreme soil conditions may occur that prevent plant growth, particularly physical conditions, gross lack of certain nutrients and toxicity. It can be important that these are identified and relieved first, otherwise the whole restoration process may either not begin, or fail after a few years. But even so, ecosystem restoration can be achieved at low cost, and the product be self-sustaining in the long term, ecological engineering of the best kind.},

It identifies a significant broadening over time in the scope of the environment question as it relates to mining, from concerns about landscape aesthetics and pollution to ecosystem health, sustainable development, and indigenous rights. A typology compares and contrasts four distinctive approaches to this question: (a) technology and management-centered accounts, defining the issue in terms of environmental performance; (b) public policy studies on the design of effective institutions for capturing benefits and allocating costs of resource development; (c) structural political economy, highlighting themes of external control, resource rights, and environmental justice; and (d) cultural studies, which illustrate how mining exemplifies many of society's anxieties about the social and environmental effects of industrialization and globalization. Each approach is examined in detail. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {Africa is on the verge of a mining boom. We review the environmental threats from African mining development, including habitat alteration, infrastructure expansion, human migration, bushmeat hunting, corruption, and weak governance. We illustrate these threats in Central Africa, which contains the vast Congo rainforest, and show that more than a quarter of 4,151 recorded mineral occurrences are concentrated in three regions of biological endemism—the Cameroon-Gabon Lowlands, Eastern DRC Lowlands, and Albertine Rift Mountains—and that most of these sites are currently unprotected. Threats are not uniform spatially, and much of the Congo Basin is devoid of mineral occurrences and may be spared from direct mining impacts. Some of the environmental impacts of African mining development could potentially be offset: mining set-asides could protect some wildlife habitats, whereas improving transportation networks could increase crop yields and spare land for conservation. Research and policy measures are needed to (1) understand the synergies between mining and other development activities, (2) improve environmental impact assessments, (3) devise mitigation and offsetting mechanisms, and (4) identify market choke points where lobbying can improve environmental practice. Without careful management, rapid mining expansion and its associated secondary effects will have severe impacts on African environments and biodiversity.},

abstract = {The impact of mining and smelting of metal ores on environmental quality is described. Mines produce large amounts of waste because the ore is only a small fraction of the total volume of the mined material. In the metal industry, production of Cu, Pb, and Zn causes the greatest degradation of the environment. Copper mining produces extensive mine wastes and tailings and Cu smelting emits approximately 0.11 Mg of S per Mg of Cu produced in the USA. Zinc and Pb smelters release large quantities of Cd and Pb into the environment. Metal smelting and refining produce gaseous (CO2, SO2, NOx, etc.) and particulate matter emissions, sewage waters, and solid wastes. Soil contamination with trace metals is considered a serious problem related to smelting; however, mining and smelting are not main sources of global metal input into soils. Other sources like discarded manufactured products, coal ash, agriculture, and transporta- tion take a lead. Smelters are the main sources of atmospheric emissions of As, Cu, Cd, Sb, and Zn on a global scale and they contribute substantially to the overall emissions of Cr, Pb, Se, and Ni. A quantitative evaluation of the environmental health effects of mining and smelting is difficult because of the complexity of factors involved and lack of consistent methodology. Nevertheless, the case studies described indicate that negative health effects could arise from Pb mining and smelting. Risk assessment revealed that food chain contamination by Cd from soils contaminated by smelting is very unlikely under the western diet.},

abstract = {Mining causes the destruction of natural ecosystems through removal of soil and vegetation and burial beneath waste disposal sites. The restoration of mined land in practice can largely be considered as ecosystem reconstruction — the reestablishment of the capability of the land to capture and retain fundamental resources. In restoration planning, it is imperative that goals, objectives, and success criteria are clearly established to allow the restoration to be undertaken in a systematic way, while realizing that these may require some modification later in light of the direction of the restoration succession. A restoration planning model is presented where the presence or absence of topsoil conserved on the site has been given the status of the primary practical issue for consideration in ecological restoration in mining. Examples and case studies are used to explore the important problems and solutions in the practice of restoration in the mining of metals and minerals. Even though ecological theory lacks general laws with universal applicability at the ecosystem level of organization, ecological knowledge does have high heuristic power and applicability to site-specific ecological restoration goals. However, monitoring and management are essential, as the uncertainties in restoration planning can never be overcome. The concept of adaptive management and the notion that a restored site be regarded as a long-term experiment is a sensible perspective. Unfortunately, in practice, the lack of post-restoration monitoring and research has meant few opportunities to improve the theory and practice of ecological restoration in mining.},

abstract = {Global demand for minerals is often considered an insignificant driver of land-use change because mines are small. We (1) investigated evidence supporting a link between global demand for steel and land-use change in Brazil's Iron Quadrangle, and (2) quantified the extent of land-use change and associated impacts on native vegetation. Historic land-use change was quantified using Landsat TM, relationships between demand for steel and land-use change were investigated using a simple linear model, and future scenarios were simulated using a calibrated land-use change model. Results support our hypothesis that global demand for steel drives extensive land-use change in the Iron Quadrangle, where increased steel production was correlated with increased iron ore production and mine expansion, and with increased charcoal production and plantation expansion. The direct impacts of mining on native vegetation were disproportionate to their relatively small spatial extent, while direct impacts of plantations were spatially extensive, as were their impacts on surrounding native vegetation. Additionally, evidence of two indirect impacts emerged during 1990-2010. Plantation expansion decreased native forest regrowth, while competition for land between mining companies and urban developers increased deforestation pressures. In combination, global demand for steel affected the majority of land in the Iron Quadrangle; however, many impacts were poorly captured by current land management approaches. Similar processes may operate in other mining regions, where global demand for minerals drives production of multiple resources (non-renewable and renewable) and thus extensive land-use change. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Mining regions undergo abrupt and extensive land use change, the impacts of which pose management challenges for mining companies and regulatory agencies. In this study we investigated 20 years of land use change in Brazil's Iron Quadrangle (QF) mining region. We classified remote sensing images to produce land use maps and conducted a Land Change analysis to investigate the causes and consequences of observed changes. The QF underwent extensive land use change between 1990 and 2010, including deforestation, plantation expansion, urbanization and mine expansion. Comparing our results with those of surrounding non-mining landscapes illustrated important differences. For example, QF contained additional highly profitable land uses, including mining and plantation forestry, which were driven by globalized markets for mineral resources. This finding suggests processes of land use change within mining regions are distinct from those found elsewhere and, as such, land management policies should reflect this. We also hypothesized four generalizations regarding these processes: 1) the direct footprints of mining expands over time, 2) the offsite footprints of mining are extensive and also often expanding, 3) the direct and indirect land used by mines causes environmental and social impacts, some of which are not captured by current management approaches, and 4) the footprints of mining (and associated impacts) are driven by global factors, many of which are uncontrollable by local land holders and regional land management plans and policies. We describe and discuss these generalizations, drawing on published evidence from other mining regions to illustrate both their generality and implications for land management.},

abstract = {Abstract The current global gold rush, driven by increasing consumption in developing countries and uncer- tainty infinancial markets, is an increasing threat for tropical ecosystems. Gold mining causes sig- nificant alteration to the environment, yet mining is often overlooked in deforestation analyses because it occupies relatively small areas. As a result,welack a comprehensive assessment of the spatial extent of gold mining impacts on tropical forests. In this study,we provide a regional assessment of gold mining deforestation in the tropical moist forest biome of South America. Specifically,we ana- lyzed the patterns of forest change in gold mining sites between 2001 and 2013, and evaluated the proximity of gold mining deforestation to protected areas (PAs). The forest cover maps were pro- duced using the Land Mapper web application and images from theMODISsatelliteMOD13Q1vege- tation indices 250mproduct. Annualmaps of forest cover were used to model the incremental change in forest in∼1600 potential gold mining sites between 2001–2006 and 2007–2013. Approximately 1680km2 of tropical moist forest was lost in these mining sites between 2001 and 2013. Deforestation was significantly higher during the 2007–2013 period, and this was associated with the increase in globaldemand for gold after the international financial crisis. More than90{\%}of the deforestation occurred in four major hotspots: Guianan moist forest ecoregion (41{\%}), SouthwestAmazonmoist forest ecoregion (28{\%}), Tapaj{\'{o}}s–Xing{\'{u}} moist forest ecoregion (11{\%}), and Magdalena Valleymon- tane forest and Magdalena–Urab{\'{a}} moist forest ecoregions (9{\%}). In addition, some of the more active zones of gold mining deforestation occurred inside or within 10kmof∼32 PAs. There is an urgent need to understand the ecological and social impacts of gold mining because it is an important cause of deforestation in the most remote forests in South America, and the impacts, particularly in aquatic systems, spread well beyond the actual mining sites.},

abstract = {The global protected area (PA) system has a key role to play in biological conservation, and it is thus vital to understand the factors that are likely to limit this potential. Attention to date has focused foremost on the consequences of biases in the spatial distribution of PAs for their effectiveness and efficiency in representing biodiversity. What is less clear is the extent to which these biases may also have affected the likelihood with which PAs coincide with or are influenced by particular kinds of threatening processes, further undermining their role. An obvious candidate for such concerns is metal mining activities. Here we demonstrate that approximately 7{\%} of mines for four key metals directly overlap with PAs and a further 27{\%} lie within 10. km of a PA boundary. Moreover, those PAs with mining activity within their boundaries constitute around 6{\%} of the total areal coverage of the global terrestrial PA system, and those with mining activity within or up to 10. km from their boundary constitute nearly 14{\%} of the total area. Given the distances over which mining activities can have influences, the persistence of their effects (often long after actual operations have closed down), and the rapidly growing demand for metals, there is an urgent need to limit or mitigate such conflicts. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

The application of fuzzy linear regression analysis to data from 145 experiments has shown that, for a 10{\%} reduction in cover, the yieM from conifer-type forest increased by some 20-25 rnm, whereas that for eucalyptus-type forest increased by only 6 mm. Both values were somewhat lower than those previously published, as was the 5 mm decrease in yield associated with a 10{\%} afforestation of scrub.

abstract = {General patterns of density, species richness and relative abundance of breeding birds are examined in a wide variety of North American forests. Taking data from censuses published in American birds, rarefaction was used to ordinate the species richness of communities in terms of samples of equal numbers of individuals. By this criterion young forests in secondary succession and mature deciduous forests can be euqally rich in bird species; coniferous forests and dense successional stands having only 1 or 2 spp. of trees have the fewest species of birds. For this data set the density of birds is higher in mature deciduous forests than in successional stands. The species/area relationship (s/a) is a function of both this species/individuals relationship (s/n) and the individuals/area relationship (n/a). According to the Jonckheere-Terpstra statistic there is a statistically significant pattern to the order in which bird communities fall with regard to s/n and n/a. To see these relationships in terms of the structure of the vegetation the positions of 56 stands in a graphic space determined by principal components are presented. Tree species richness and canopy cover dominate the 1st axis, and variation in canopy height the 2nd. Tree density has a somewhat independent pattern of variation and is expressed by the 3rd axis. In the bivariate space of principal components 1 and 3, a SYMAP contour diagram of the number of bird species expected in 10 ha (s/a) shows maximal values in mature deciduous forests, but not in those that have the highest tree species richness, canopy height or tree density. The number of individual birds per 10 ha (n/a) shows a similar pattern except that maximal density occurs at maximal values of tree species richness and canopy height. By this criterion both bird species richness and density are minimal in coniferous forests characterized by high tree density, low canopy and few species of trees.},

Factorial fertilization with nitrogen, phosphorus, and all other essential nutrients (combined) was applied to the two younger sites; only nitrogen was applied to the oldest one. Nitrogen supply represented the most important limitation to plant growth in the two younger sites; additions of nitrogen caused significant increases in tree diameter increment, height growth, litterfall, and most other growth-related parameters. In contrast, nitrogen additions had no significant effect on plant growth in the oldest site. Phosphorus additions increased extractable soil phosphorus and plant tissue phosphorus, but did not increase plant growth at the young sites. The results are consistent with Walker {\&} Syers' (1976) model for the control of nutrient limitation during soil development. CR - Copyright {\&}{\#}169; 1993 Springer},

abstract = {Identifying historical forest disturbances is difficult, especially in selectively logged areas. LiDAR is able to measure fine-scale variations in forest structure over multiple kilometers. We use LiDAR data from ca. 16 km2 of forest in Sierra Leone, West Africa, to discriminate areas of old-growth from areas recovering from selective logging for 23 years. We examined canopy height variation and gap size distributions. We found that though recovering blocks of forest differed little in height from old-growth forest (up to 3 m), they had a greater area of canopy gaps (average 10.2{\%} gap fraction in logged areas, compared to 5.6{\%} in unlogged area); and greater numbers of gaps penetrating to the forest floor (162 gaps at 2 m height in logged blocks, and 101 in an unlogged block). Comparison of LiDAR measurements with field data demonstrated that LiDAR delivered accurate results. We found that gap size distributions deviated from power-laws reported previously, with substantially fewer large gaps than predicted by power-law functions. Our analyses demonstrate that LiDAR is a useful tool for distinguishing structural differences between old-growth and old-secondary forests. That makes LiDAR a powerful tool for REDD+ (Reduction of Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) programs implementation and conservation planning.},

abstract = {Rates of ecosystem recovery following disturbance affect many ecological processes, including carbon cycling in the biosphere. Here, we present a model that predicts the temperature dependence of the biomass accumulation rate following disturbances in forests. Model predictions are derived based on allometric and biochemical principles that govern plant energetics and are tested using a global database of 91 studies of secondary succession compiled from the literature. The rate of biomass accumulation during secondary succession increases with average growing season temperature as predicted based on the biochemical kinetics of photosynthesis in chloroplasts. In addition, the rate of biomass accumulation is greater in angiosperm-dominated communities than in gymnosperm-dominated ones and greater in plantations than in naturally regenerating stands. By linking the temperature-dependence of photosynthesis to the rate of whole-ecosystem biomass accumulation during secondary succession, our model and results provide one example of how emergent, ecosystem-level rate processes can be predicted based on the kinetics of individual metabolic rate.},

abstract = {Questions: Primary succession, measured by changes in species composition, is slow, usually forcing a chronose-quence approach. A unique data set is used to explore spatial and temporal changes in vegetation structure after a 1980 volcanic eruption. On the basis of data from a transect of 20 permanent plots with an altitudinal range of 250 m sampled through 2005, two questions are asked: Do changes along the transect recapitulate succession? Do plots converge to similar composition over time? Location: A ridge between 1218 and 1468 m on Mount St. Helens, Washington, USA. Methods: Repeat sampling of plots for species cover along a 1-km transect. Floristic changes were characterized by tech-niques including DCA, clustering and similarity. Results: Species richness and cover increased with time at rates that decreased with increasing elevation. The establish-ment of Lupinus lepidus accelerated the rate of succession and may control its trajectory. Diversity (H') at first increased with richness, then declined as dominance hierarchies developed. Primary succession was characterized by overlapping phases of species assembly (richness), vegetation maturation (diversity peaks, cover expands) and inhibition (diversity declines). Each plot passed through several community classes, but by 2005, only four classes persisted. Succession trajectories (measured by DCA) became shorter with elevation. Similarity between groups of plots defined by their classification in 2005 did not increase with time. Similarity within plot groups converged slightly at the lower elevations. Despite similarities between temporal and spatial trends in composition, trajectories of higher plots do not recapitulate those of lower plots, apparently because Lupinus was not an early colonist. Any vegetation convergence has been limited to plots that are in close proximity.},

These maps and databases are being released in blocks of states or, in the case of Alaska, as compiled blocks of 1:250,000-scale quadrangles as chapters in this series.  For Alaska, formal maps as well as databases are being published here, whereas for the conterminous U.S. only state databases and preview graphics are presented, because published maps for most states already exist.  For Alaska these regional compilations will form the base for compiling a new geologic map of the state.

The ability to predict ecological responses has often been hampered by our rather limited understanding of trophic interactions. Indeed, it has proven difficult to discern direct and indirect effects of environmental change on animal populations owing to limited information about vegetation at large temporal and spatial scales. The rapidly increasing use of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) in ecological studies has recently changed this situation.

abstract = {Each year surface mining in Appalachia disrupts large areas of forested land. The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act requires coal mine operators to establish a permanent vegetative cover after mining, and current practice emphasizes soil compaction and planting of competitive forage grasses to stabilize the site and control erosion. These practices hinder recolonization of native hardwood trees on these reclaimed sites. Recently reclamation scientists and regulators have encouraged re-establishment of hardwood forests on surface mined land through careful selection and placement of rooting media and proper selection and planting of herbaceous and tree species. To evaluate the effect of rooting media and soil amendments, a 2.8-ha experimental plot was established, with half of the plot being constructed of weathered brown sandstone and half constructed of unweathered gray sandstone. Bark mulch was applied to an area covering both sandstone types, and the ends of the plot were hydroseeded with a tree-compatible herbaceous seed mix, resulting in eight soil treatments. Twelve hardwood tree species were planted, and soil chemical properties and tree growth were measured annually from 2007 to 2012. After six growing seasons, average tree volume index was higher for trees grown on brown sandstone (5333 cm3) compared with gray sandstone (3031 cm3). Trees planted in mulch outperformed trees on nonmulched treatments (volume index of 6187 cm3 vs. 4194 cm3). Hydroseeding with a tree-compatible mix produced greater ground cover (35 vs. 15{\%}) and resulted in greater tree volume index than nonhydroseed areas (5809 vs. 3403 cm3). Soil chemical properties were improved by mulch and improved tree growth, especially on gray sandstone. The average pH of brown sandstone was 5.0 to 5.4, and gray sandstone averaged pH 6.9 to 7.7. The mulch treatment on gray sandstone resulted in tree growth similar to brown sandstone alone and with mulch. After 6 yr, tree growth on brown sandstone was about double the tree growth on gray sandstone, and mulch was a successful amendment to improve tree growth. {\%}@ 0047-2425 160.{\%}0 Journal Article},

abstract = {1. The ordinary processes of migration bring the reproductive bodies of a single plant or a species of plant into many places. 2. The ordinary processes of migration bring the reproductive bodies of various plants into the same place. 3. Of the various species which reach one spot of ground, the local environment determines which may live, depending on the individual physiological demands of each species separately. 4. On every spot of ground, the environment varies in time, and consequently the vegetation varies in time. 5. At any given time, the environment varies in space, and consequently vegetation varies in space. 6. A piece of vegetation which maintains a reasonable degree of homogeneity over an appreciable area and a reasonable permanence over a considerable time may be designated as a unit community. Within such an area and during such a period similarity in environmental selection tends toward similarity in vegetation. 7. Since every community varies in structure, and since no two communities are precisely alike, or have genetic or dynamic connection, a precisely logical classification of communities is not possible. Although a summary is generally considered to close a discussion, it nevertheless seems desirable to indicate very briefly the relation of the individualistic concept to other current philosophies of the plant community. The individualistic concept is totally at variance with the idea that the association is an organism, represented by many individuals, and also does not admit an analogy or homology between the species and the association. While affirming the existence of definite communities, characterized by reasonable uniformity over a considerable area terminated by a definite boundary, the concept denies that all vegetation is thus segregated into communities. The concept is by no means opposed to the recognition of the synusia, or union, defining it as a group of plants whose physiological demands are so similar that they are regularly selected by the same environment and consequently regularly live together. If classification of communities on the basis of floristic resemblance is rejected, and if broader areas of vegetation are searched for characters indicating genetic or dynamic similarity, these are first found in the broad floristic group now known as a biome. The plants of a biome, living together now as their ancestors have lived together and evolved together in the past, represent an environmental selection of a broad type, while lociation and faciation within the biome indicate the variability of the environment and the irregularity of migration.},

Additional experiments were conducted for both Spartina cynosuroides and Borrichia frutescens to determine if sulfide also influences the overall distribution of these species in the marsh. In situ soluble sulfide concentrations ranged from 0.02 mM in creek bank sites up to 3.0 mM in the inner marsh. In culture treatments, both plant height and biomass production of S. alterniflora were inhibited at a sulfide concentration as low as 1.0 mM, strongly suggesting a role for sulfide in the determination of height forms in the marsh. Production of S. cynosuroides was inhibited at high sulfide concentrations. However, over a range of concentrations similar to in situ values, no significant reduction in growth was observed, indicating sulfide was not a primary determinant of growth in stands of S. cynosuroides on Sapelo Island, Georgia. A sulfide concentration of 0.5 mM inhibited production in B frutescens. In situ sulfide concentrations as high as 0.5 mM were found only in mixed stands of Juncus roemerianus and B. frutescens.},

abstract = {Sulfate reduction rates were measured for 2 years in the peat of a salt marsh by a radiotracer technique. Rates are high throughout the peat, from the surface to more than 20 cm deep. The integrated annual rate is about 75 mol SOd2-. n-2. yr- ‘, the highest yet reported for any natural ecosystem. Sulfate reduction accounts for the consumption of 1,800 g org-C. xn2. yr-‘, about equal to net primary production in the marsh. Respiration using other electron acceptors (such as oxygen or nitrate) is much less important. Sulfate reduction rates in the peat of the salt marsh are probably high for at least three reasons: the belowground production of Spartina alternijh-a provides a large, annual input of organic substrates over a depth of some 20 cm; sulfate is rapidly resupplied to the peat in infiltrating tidal waters, so that sulfate depletion never limits the rate of reduction; and sulfide concentrations remain below toxic levels. The stable pyrite (FeS,) is a major end product of sulfate reduction in the marsh peat while iron monosulfide (FeS) is not. If the incorporation of 35S into pyrite were not measured, the [35S]S0,2- reduction measurements would greatly underestimate the true rate of sulfate reduction. Pyrite acts largely as a temporary store of reduced sulfur, with seasonal changes in its concentration.},

abstract = {Coastal wetlands store vast amounts of organic carbon, globally, and are becoming increasingly vulnerable to the effects of anthropogenic sea-level rise. To understand the effect of sea-level rise on organic carbon fate and preservation in this global sink, it is necessary to characterize differences in the biogeochemical stability of coastal wetland soil organic carbon (SOC). Here, we use ramped pyrolysis/oxidation decomposition characteristics as proxies for SOC stability to understand the fate of carbon storage in coastal wetlands comprising the Mississippi River deltaic plain, undergoing rapid rates of local sea level rise. Soils from three wetland types (fresh, brackish, and salt marshes) along a salinity gradient were subjected to ramped pyrolysis analysis to evaluate decomposition characteristics related to thermochemical stability of SOC. At equivalent soil depths, we observed that fresh marsh SOC was more stable than brackish and salt marsh SOC. Depth, isotopic, elemental, and chemical compositions, bulk density, and water content of SOC all exhibited different relationships with SOC stability across the marsh salinity gradient, indicative of different controls on SOC stability within each marsh type. The differences in stability imply stronger preservation potential of fresh marsh soil carbon, compared to that of salt and brackish marshes. Considering projected marsh ecosystem responses to sea-level rise, these observed stability differences are important in planning and implementing coastal wetland carbon-focused remediation and improving climate model feedbacks with the carbon cycle. Specifically, our results imply that ecosystem changes associated with sea-level rise will initiate the accumulation of less stable carbon in coastal wetlands. This article is protected by copyright.

abstract = {Complexity theory predicts that local feedback processes may strongly affect the organization of ecosystems on larger spatial scales. Whether complexity leads to increased resilience and stability or to increased vulnerability and criticality remains one of the dominant questions in ecology. We present a combined theoretical and empirical study of complex dynamics in mineral- ogenic salt marsh ecosystems that emerge from a positive feedback between clay accumulation and plant growth. Positive feedback induces self-organizing within the ecosystem, which buffers for the strong physical gradient that characterizes the marine-terrestrial boundary, and improves plant growth along the gradient. However, as a consequence of these self-organizing properties, salt marshes approach a critical state as the edge of the salt marsh and the adjacent intertidal flat becomes increasingly steep and vulnerable to wave attack. Disturbance caused, for instance, by a storm may induce a cascade of vegetation collapse and severe erosion on the cliff edge, leading to salt marsh destruction. Our study shows that on short timescales, self-organization improves the functioning of salt marsh ecosystems. On long timescales, however, self-organization may lead to destruction of salt marsh vegetation.},

abstract = {The transport of particulate and dissolved matter on the surface of coastal marshes is controlled by the hydrodynamic characteristics of over-marsh flows. High-frequency (5 Hz) in situ measurements of flow speed were collected in Spartina alterniflora, Juncus roemerianus, and Distichlis spicata canopies using hot-film anemometry sensor arrays. These data indicate that mean flow speed, turbulence intensity, and the shape of the vertical speed profile are influenced by variations in plant morphology and stem density. Mean flow speed and turbulence intensity are inversely related to stem density and to distance from the creek edge. Flow energies decrease by about one order of magnitude when flows encounter the vegetated marsh surface and continue to decrease as vegetation density increases. Turbulent flow energy also decays exponentially with increasing distance from the creek edge. Reductions in flow speed coupled with energy decay provide a hydrologic mechanism for sediment deposition patterns commonly observed in marsh systems. Suspended matter transport is also affected by plant-flow interactions. Vertical flow structure is strongly influenced by canopy morphology (plant type and plant shape). Plant-flow interactions result in vertical speed profiles whose shapes deviate from the logarithmic profile typical in free-stream conditions and in the development of transitional flow regimes (i.e. neither laminar nor fully turbulent).},

abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of uniqueness of catchment areas in relation to model representations of flow processes. The uniqueness of field measurements as a limitation on model representations is discussed. The treatment of uniqueness as a residual from a modelled relationship may conceal information about the uniqueness of catchments, while the treatment of uniqueness as a set of parameter values within a particular model structure is problematic due to the equifinality of model structures and parameter sets. The analysis suggests that a fully reductionist approach to describe the uniqueness of individual catchment areas by the aggregation of descriptions of small scale behaviour will be impossible given current measurement technologies. A suggested strategy for the representation of uniqueness of place as a fuzzy mapping of the landscape into a model space is suggested. This will lead to a quantification of the uncertainty in predictions of any particular location in a way that allows a conditioning of the mapping on the basis of the available data. This process can incorporate a hypothesis testing approach to model evaluation but the problem of multiple behavioural models may provide an ultimate limitation on the realism of process representations: not on the principle of realism but on the possibility of unambiguous process representations.},

We sampled 71 lakes in northern Michigan, U.S.A. and measured lake landscape position and landscape characteristics around each lake (e.g., land use/cover and geology) to answer two questions: (1) which metric of landscape position explains the most variation in lake water chemistry/clarity? and (2) what landscape and physical features are also related to landscape position? All four landscape position metrics explained significant variation in some water chemistry/clarity variables. However, lake order, the metric based on stream order, consistently explained the most variation, ranging from 22{\%} (dissolved organic carbon) to 53{\%} (conductivity and calcium), with lake hydrology, the metric based on both streams and lakes, explaining similar amounts of variation to lake order, but less overall. Landscape position was also significantly related to both lake morphometry and the proportion of wetland types in buffer areas, which may help explain why landscape position is related to lake water chemistry and clarity variables.},

Reductions of suspended sediment load, absent of dramatic reductions in nutrients, will likely further reduce net CO2 emissions from the river.

abstract = {We propose an integrated, heuristic model of lotic biocomplexity across spatiotemporal scales from headwaters to large rivers. This riverine ecosystem synthesis (RES) provides a framework for understanding both broad, often discontinuous patterns along longitudinal and lateral dimensions of river networks and local ecological patterns across various temporal and smaller spatial scales. Rather than posing a completely new model, we arrange a conceptual marriage of eco-geomorphology (ecological aspects of fluvial geomorphology) with a terrestrial landscape model describing hierarchical patch dynamics. We modify five components of this terrestrial model for lotic ecosystems: (1) nested, discontinuous hierarchies of patch mosaics; (2) ecosystem dynamics as a composite of intra- and inter-patch dynamics; (3) linked patterns and processes; (4) dominance of non-equilibria] and stochastic processes; and (5) formation of a quasi-equilibrial, metastable state. Our conceptual model blends our perspectives on biocomplexity with aspects of aquatic models proposed from 1980-2004. Contrasting with a common view of rivers as continuous, longitudinal gradients in physical conditions, the RES portrays rivers as downstream arrays of large hydrogeomorphic patches (e.g. constricted, braided and floodplain channel areas) formed by catchment geomorphology and climate. The longitudinal distribution of these patches, which are identifiable using standard geomorphic techniques, varies amongst rivers and is difficult to forecast above ecoregional scales. Some types of hydrogeomorphic patches may reoccur along this downstream passage. Unique ecological 'functional process zones' are formed by individual types of hydrogeomorphic patches because of physiochemical habitat differences which affect ecosystem structure and function. The RES currently includes 14 tenets predicting how patterns of individual species distributions, community regulation, lotic ecosystem processes, and floodplain interactions will vary over spatiotemporal scales, especially as they relate to the functional process zones formed by hydrogeomorphic differences in the river network.

abstract = {Freshwater estuaries may be important control points but have received limited research attention, emblematic of a general under-appreciation of these ecosystems and the services they provide. These ecotone environments exist at the interface of rivers flowing into large lakes, where seiches cause mixing of lotic and lentic waters within flooded river deltas. We assessed the dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) retention and processing controls in the Saint Louis River Estuary (SLRE), which receives inputs from rivers, urban sources, and Lake Superior. Nitrate (NO3–N) was the dominant form of DIN and was consistently highest in the lower estuary due to seiche-delivered Lake Superior water and nitrification of ammonium from urban sources. The estuary transitioned from a net NO3–N source during high flows to a net sink during summer baseflow conditions. NO3–N availability controlled site-specific denitrification rates while sediment organic matter explained the spatial pattern in denitrification potential. As the estuary shifted from a riverine state to one with more lake influence, seiches delivered Lake Superior NO3–N to the lower portion of the estuary, alleviating the final denitrification control and activating the estuary's ‘denitrification pump'. This amplified removal condition is maintained by critically delivered NO3–N during periods of warm temperatures and long residence times. Often these controls are unsynchronized in streams where NO3–N is typically lowest during summer baseflow. Similar ephemeral biogeochemical processes are likely found within other seiche-prone lakes where organic-rich sediments accumulate at river mouths and are supplied with chemically distinct lake water during low flow periods. {\textcopyright} 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

abstract = {Big rivers dominate the world's continental surface, yet we are still learning about how they operate and whether they are explicably different, not only from each other, but also from smaller rivers. This paper uses global satellite imagery and ground field-experience to explain and illustrate why and how big rivers are strongly differentiated.At the largest scale, trans-continent sized rivers do not possess unified valley systems created by fluvial erosion but instead involve chains of interlinked domains with contrasted fluvial functions. Alluvial settings are dependent on mainstream and tributary inputs of water and sediment, but big river channel pattern variety is determined by contrasts in sediment feed-rates and differences in the rates and routes of sediment exchange. Four modes of alluvial exchange are recognised: (i) deposition on the floodplain (e.g., levees, infilled palaeochannels and floodbasins), (ii) exchanges involving main channels (e.g., bank erosion and accretion), (iii) deposition within main channels (e.g. bedforms from metres to 10s of kilometres in size), and (iv) material input from tributaries (sediment-rich or sediment-poor). Different combinations of sedimentation activity lead to floodplain morphologies for big rivers that can be classified into four types: (i) lacustrine-dominated, (ii) mainstream-dominated, (iii) tributary or accessory-stream dominated, and (iv) confined or bedrock-dominated.Channel patterning involves a range of main-channel, branch and floodplain styles promoted by variable sediment feeds, complex bed sediment transfers, variable lateral sediment exchanges, plural channel systems and incomplete mineral sedimentation of the hydraulic corridors set by tectonics and prior-valley trenching. In some of the world's largest rivers it is accessory and tributary channels, rather than main-river branches, which determine patterns of floodplain morphology. In some big rivers, but certainly not all, ponded lacustrine environments are common, with water bodies that vary from smaller water-filled swales and palaeochannels, to floodbasins and km-scale linear lakes in sediment-dammed tributaries. Organic sedimentation is significant along relatively sediment-poor and laterally-stable large rivers that fail to fill their alluvial corridors. Three case studies are used to illustrate this variability in big river pattern and process: the Ob, Jamuna and Paran??. These rivers are respectively dominated by meandering, braiding and mixed mainstream and accessory channel morphologies.Big rivers have some processes and patterns that are different from smaller rivers including: (i) no simple down-valley sequence in control variables and channel pattern, (ii) main channels with high width:depth ratios, (iii) few or no channel-wide unit bars migrating through the main thalwegs, (iv) extensive and low-gradient floodplains that provide space for channel shifting and floodplain sedimentation, (v) long distances between significant tributaries to allow full mixing of water and sediment discharges, (vi) in some places, partially-decoupled channels and floodplains, and (vii) significant floodplain water bodies that readily act as sinks for fine-grained sediment where this is supplied, or organic deposition.Although understanding of contemporary big river patterns requires attention to a range of timescales, including inheritance from sediments of Quaternary age, big rivers do have a distinctive character. The variety of patterns on big rivers may usefully be viewed in terms of sediment systems operating at both the catchment and reach scales. Intra-river variability and internal complexity show the need to understand contrasted sediment supply, through-put and alluvial exchange as determinants of big river morphology and pattern. ?? 2012.},

Given recent focus on large rivers as conduits for excess nutrients to coastal zones, their role in processing and retaining nutrients has been overlooked and understudied. Empirical measurements of nutrient uptake in large rivers are lacking, despite a substantial body of knowledge on nutrient transport and removal in smaller streams. Researchers interested in nutrient transport by rivers (discharge {\textgreater} 10 000 L/s) are left to extrapolate riverine nutrient demand using a modeling framework or a mass balance approach. To begin to fill this knowledge gap, we present data using a pulse method to measure inorganic nitrogen (N) transport and removal in the Upper Snake River, Wyoming, USA (seventh order, discharge 12 000 L/s). We found that the Upper Snake had surprisingly high biotic demand relative to smaller streams in the same river network for both ammonium (NH4+) and nitrate (N03{\~{}}). Placed in the context of a meta-analysis of previously published nutrient uptake studies, these data suggest that large rivers may have similar biotic demand for N as smaller tributaries. We also found that demand for different forms of inorganic N (NH4+ vs. N03{\~{}}) scaled differently with stream size. Data from rivers like the Upper Snake and larger are essential for effective water quality management at the scale of river networks. Empirical measurements of solute dynamics in large rivers are needed to understand the role of whole river networks (as opposed to stream reaches) in patterns of nutrient export at regional and continental scales.},

abstract = {1. This review is presented as a broad synthesis of riverine landscape diversity, beginning with an account of the variety of landscape elements contained within river corridors. Landscape dynamics within river corridors are then examined in the context of landscape evolution, ecological succession and turnover rates of landscape elements. This is followed by an overview of the role of connectivity and ends with a riverine landscape perspective of biodiversity. 2. River corridors in the natural state are characterised by a diverse array of landscape elements, including surface waters (a gradient of lotic and lentic waterbodies), the fluvial stygoscape (alluvial aquifers), riparian systems (alluvial forests, marshes, meadows) and geomorphic features (bars and islands, ridges and swales, levees and terraces, fans and deltas, fringing floodplains, wood debris deposits and channel networks). 3. Fluvial action (erosion, transport, deposition) is the predominant agent of landscape evolution and also constitutes the natural disturbance regime primarily responsible for sustaining a high level of landscape diversity in river corridors. Although individual landscape features may exhibit high turnover, largely as a function of the interactions between fluvial dynamics and successional phenomena, their relative abundance in the river corridor tends to remain constant over ecological time. 4. Hydrological connectivity, the exchange of matter, energy and biota via the aqueous medium, plays a major though poorly understood role in sustaining riverine landscape diversity. Rigorous investigations of connectivity in diverse river systems should provide considerable insight into landscape-level functional processes. 5. The species pool in riverine landscapes is derived from terrestrial and aquatic communities inhabiting diverse lotic, lentic, riparian and groundwater habitats arrayed across spatio-temporal gradients. Natural disturbance regimes are responsible for both expanding the resource gradient in riverine landscapes as well as for constraining competitive exclusion. 6. Riverine landscapes provide an ideal setting for investigating how complex interactions between disturbance and productivity structure species diversity patterns.},

abstract = {Spatio-temporal heterogeneity in physico-chemical conditions associated with the annual expansion/contraction cycle in a complex glacial flood plain of the Swiss Alps was investigated employing a landscape approach. The diverse and dynamic aquatic habitats of the flood plain were visualized as an aquatic mosaic or riverscape. Based on samples collected at ca. monthly intervals for 1.5 yr along 17 floodplain transects, the 3 components of riverscape heterogeneity, extent, composition, and configuration, were quantified using categorical maps and indices of landscape patterns for turbidity and specific conductance. Changes in the spatial heterogeneity of 13 other physico-chemical parameters were further analyzed by means of a within-dates principal component analysis. Riverscape heterogeneity (RH), quantified by applying several indices of landscape pattern to turbidity and specific conductance data, was minimum during groundwater-dominated base flow in winter. Despite an increase in surface connectivity in the channel network with rising discharge, RH rose in spring and summer as additional chemically-distinct water sources (i.e., snowmelt runoff and glacial ablation) contributed to surface flow within the flood plain. Most other physico-chemical variables measured during this study exhibited the same spatio-temporal heterogeneity as turbidity and specific conductance. Overall, the glacial flood plain shifted from a monotonous physico-chemical riverscape in winter to a complex mosaic in summer, this seasonal pattern being clearly driven by hydrological factors operating at the catchment scale rather than by autogenic processes within individual water bodies. Although RH exhibited a predictable annual pattern in response to the seasonal flow regime, we expect the channel network to undergo future modifications from stochastic factors associated with flood events and long-term changes reflecting movements of the glaciers.},

abstract = {We present a method for estimating nitrogen (N) removal based on high-resolution longitudinal profiling, which facilitates repeated measurement in larger rivers. The Lagrangian reference frame allows removal to be spatially disaggregated, enabling identification of removal “hot spots,” and potentially passive assessment of reaction kinetics using ambient longitudinal concentration gradients. Applying the method in six spring-fed rivers in North Florida, we tested the hypothesis that removal is controlled by spatial variation in channel hydraulics and vegetation. Removal estimates obtained using this method were statistically robust, spatially consistent across replicate profiles, and comparable to measurements made in these and other systems of similar size using alternative methods. We observed significantly increased removal in reaches with lower specific discharge and in more heavily vegetated reaches. Assessing uptake kinetics directly from longitudinal profiles assumes negligible sampling effects from temporally variable removal, non-instantaneous sampling velocities, and the mixing of water along the flowpath. Results from a reactive transport model suggest these effects are significant, producing complex profile geometries. Relatively small differences between alternative kinetic models substantially limit inferences about reaction order when utilizing the small concentration gradients observed longitudinally within rivers. Across rivers, N removal follows either efficiency-loss (exponent = 0.39) or Michaelis–Menten kinetics, but not zero- or first-order kinetics.},

At finer reach length scales (e.g., 0.25–1 km), longitudinal extraction of b exponents represents the first continuous mapping of a classical hydraulic geometry parameter from space.

abstract = {Drainage basins in many parts of the world are ungauged or poorly gauged, and in some cases existing measurement networks are declining. The problem is compounded by the impacts of human-induced changes to the land surface and climate, occurring at the local, regional and global scales. Predictions of ungauged or poorly gauged basins under these conditions are highly uncertain. The IAHS Decade on Predictions in Ungauged Basins, or PUB, is a new initiative launched by the International Association of Hydrological Sciences (IAHS), aimed at formulating and implementing appropriate science programmes to engage and energize the scientific community, in a coordinated manner, towards achieving major advances in the capacity to make predictions in ungauged basins. The PUB scientific programme focuses on the estimation of predictive uncertainty, and its subsequent reduction, as its central theme. A general hydrological prediction system contains three components: (a) a model that describes the key processes of interest, (b) a set of parameters that represent those landscape properties that govern critical processes, and (c) appropriate meteorological inputs (where needed) that drive the basin response. Each of these three components of the prediction system, is either not known at all, or at best known imperfectly, due to the inherent multi-scale space–time heterogeneity of the hydrological system, especially in ungauged basins. PUB will therefore include a set of targeted scientific programmes that attempt to make inferences about climatic inputs, parameters and model structures from available but inadequate data and process knowledge, at the basin of interest and/or from other similar basins, with robust measures of the uncertainties involved, and their impacts on predictive uncertainty. Through generation of improved understanding, and methods for the efficient quantification of the underlying multi-scale heterogeneity of the basin and its response, PUB will inexorably lead to new, innovative methods for hydrological predictions in ungauged basins in different parts of the world, combined with significant reductions of predictive uncertainty. In this way, PUB will demonstrate the value of data, as well as provide the information needed to make predictions in ungauged basins, and assist in capacity building in the use of new technologies. This paper presents a summary of the science and implementation plan of PUB, with a call to the hydrological community to participate actively in the realization of these goals.},

abstract = {The serial discontinuity concept (SDC) was developed as a theoretical construct that views impoundments as major disruptions of longitudinal resource gradients along river courses. According to the SDC, dams result in upstream-downstream shifts in biotic and abiotic patterns and processes; the direction and extent of the displacement depend on the variable of interest and are a function of dam position along the river continuum. As originally formulated, the SDC did not consider interactions between the river and its flood plain. The new perspective presented herein is an initial attempt to encompass the dynamics of alluvial flood plain rivers into the model using a three reach characterization: constrained headwater reach, braided reach and meandering reach. The constrained headwater reach has conditions similar to those described in the original SDC, but the braided and meandering reaches provide a perspective that was not addressed in the model. Lateral interactions between the channel and the flood plain are critical to a holistic understanding of natural river ecosystems and the alterations induced by regulation. The fringing flood plain, with its diverse water bodies and alluvial forest mosaic, is considered an integral part of the river system.},

In order to develop empirical algorithms for CDOM and DOC, the CDOM absorption coefficient (aCDOM) was correlated with in situ remote sensing reflectance band ratios, and DOC was then derived from aCDOM through the aCDOM to DOC relationships. Our validation analyses demonstrate successful retrieval of DOC and CDOM using MODIS and SeaWiFS with mean absolute percent differences from field measurements of 9.3 ± 7.3{\%} for DOC, 19 ± 14{\%} for aCDOM(355), 15.5 ± 12{\%} for aCDOM(443), and 8.6 ± 4.9{\%} for the CDOM spectral slope. To our knowledge, the algorithms presented here represent the first validated algorithms for satellite retrieval of aCDOM, DOC, and CDOM spectral slope in the coastal ocean. Satellite imagery demonstrates the importance of riverine/estuarine discharge from Chesapeake Bay and Delaware Bay to the export of CDOM and DOC to the coastal ocean. Between spring and summer, photooxidation has a significant impact on CDOM distributions resulting in a pronounced decrease in aCDOM between the midshelf and continental slope region of the MAB. The satellite-derived DOC products demonstrate the net ecosystem production of DOC of 12 to 34 $\mu$mol C L−1 between spring and summer. The aCDOM algorithms presented here are applicable to other coastal regions and can also be used to retrieve DOC using region-specific aCDOM to DOC relationships.},

The algorithm utilizes techniques of boundary definition to extract a river centerline, derives a line segment that is orthogonal to this line at each centerline pixel, and then computes the total river width along each orthogonal. The output of RivWidth is comparable in quality to measurements derived using manual techniques; yet, it continuously generates thousands of width values along an entire stream course, even in multichannel river systems. Uncertainty in RivWidth principally depends on the quality of the water classification used as an input, though pixel resolution and the values of input parameters play lesser roles. Source code for RivWidth can be obtained by visiting http://pavelsky.googlepages.com/rivwidth.},

abstract = {This paper explains the multi-way decomposition method PARAFAC and its use in chemometrics. PARAFAC is a generalization of PCA to higher order arrays, but some of the characteristics of the method are quite different from the ordinary two-way case. There is no rotation problem in PARAFAC, and e.g., pure spectra can be recovered from multi-way spectral data. One cannot as in PCA estimate components successively as this will give a model with poorer fit, than if the simultaneous solution is estimated. Finally sealing and centering is not as straightforward in the multi-way case as in the two- way case. An important advantage of using multi-way methods instead of unfolding methods is that the estimated models are very simple in a mathematical sense, and therefore more robust and easier to interpret. All these aspects plus more are explained in this tutorial and an implementation in Matlab code is available, that contains most of the features explained in the text. Three examples show how PARAFAC can be used for specific problems. The applications include subjects as: Analysis of variance by PARAFAC, a five-way application of PARAFAC, PARAFAC with half the elements missing, PARAFAC constrained to positive solutions and PARAFAC for regression as in principal component regression.},

abstract = {To investigate the composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) as a function of apparent molecular weight (MW) by rapid analytical methods, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-size exclusion chromatography (SEC) was conducted with sequential on-line detectors consisting of UV, fluorescence, and quantitative DOC measurement. Fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) spectrophotometry was used to select wavelengths for the HPSEC on-line fluorescence system. The chosen peak maxima locations of excitation-emission wavelengths were 278-353nm for protein-like substances and 337-423nm for fulvic-like substances based on an analysis of EEM spectra for various samples and reference materials. This system provides quantitative and qualitative information on the specific MW components of DOM, including proportion of DOC (by DOC measurement), aromaticity (by comparison of UV and DOC measurements), and chemical properties (by fluorescence measurement). It further allows determination of organic matter characteristics (e.g., fulvic-like, protein-like, and polysaccharide-like substances) as a function of MW. Three types of samples (Irvine Ranch ground water (IRWD-GW), Barr Lake surface water (BL-SW), and Hawaii wastewater secondary effluent) were analyzed by the HPSEC-UVA-fluorescence-DOC system. These results were compared with fluorescence EEM for samples fractionated by HPLC-SEC. The DOM fraction in the high apparent MW range (over 10,000g/mol) consisted of polysaccharide-like substances for IRWD-GW and a mixture of polysaccharide-like/protein-like substances for BL-SW and wastewater secondary effluent. Minimal amounts of fulvic-like substances were found in the wastewater secondary effluent sample. The DOM fractions in a medium apparent MW range (5000-1000g/mol) showed higher aromaticity (fulvic in character) than any other fractions for all samples. For the DOM fraction in the low apparent MW range (below 680g/mol), additional aliphatic organic matter was found in IRWD-GW, while BL-SW contained protein-like processes. DOM plays an important role in drinking water and wastewater treatment processes. An enhanced HPSEC technique with multiple on-line detectors enables a better understanding of quantitative and qualitative DOM properties and can help to design and optimize water/wastewater treatment facilities. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The Earth's surface morphology, in an abiotic context, is a consequence of major forcings such as tectonic uplift, erosion, sediment transport, and climate. Recently, however, it has become essential for the geomorphological community to also take into account biota as a geomorphological agent that has a role in shaping the landscape, even if at a different scale and magnitude from that of geology. Although the modern literature is flourishing on the impacts of vegetation on geomorphic processes, the study of anthropogenic pressures on geomorphology is still in its early stages. Topography emerges as a result of natural driving forces, but some human activities (such as mining, agricultural practices and the construction of road networks) directly or indirectly move large quantities of soil, which leave clear topographic signatures embedded on the Earth's morphology. These signatures can cause drastic changes to the geomorphological organization of the landscape, with direct consequences on Earth surface processes. This review provides an overview of the recent literature on the role of humans as a geological agent in shaping the morphology of the landscape. We explore different contexts that are significantly characterized by anthropogenic topographic signatures: landscapes affected by mining activities, road networks and agricultural practices. We underline the main characteristics of those landscapes and the implications of human impacts on Earth surface processes. The final section considers future challenges wherein we explore recent novelties and trials in the concept of anthropogenic geomorphology. Herein, we focus on the role of high-resolution topographic and remote-sensing technologies. The reconstruction or identification of artificial or anthropogenic topographies provides a mechanism for quantifying anthropogenic changes to landscape systems. This study may allow an improved understanding and targeted mitigation of the processes driving geomorphic changes during anthropogenic development and help guide future research directions for development-based watershed studies. Human society is deeply affecting the environment with consequences on the landscape. Therefore, establishing improved management measures that consider the Earth's rapidly changing systems is fundamental.},

abstract = {This work tests the capability of a recently published topographic index, the Slope Local Length of Auto-correlation (SLLAC), to portrait and delineate anthropogenic geomorphologies. The patterns of the anthropogenic pressure are defined considering the road network density and the Urban Complexity Index (UCI). First, the research investigates the changes in the SLLAC in two derived parameters (average SLLAC and the SLLAC surface peak curvature – Spc – per km2) connected to the increasing of the anthropogenic structures. Next, natural and anthropogenic landscapes are clustered and classified. The results show that there is a direct correlation between the road network density and the UCI, and the mean SLLAC per km2. However, the Spc is inversely correlated with the anthropogenic pressure (network density and urban complexity). This shows that the surface morphology (slope) of regions presenting anthropogenic structures tends to be well organized (low Spc) and, in general, self-similar at a long distance (higher average SLLAC). The results of the clustering approach show that the procedure can correctly depict anthropogenic landscapes having a road network density greater than about 3 km/km2, also in areas covered by vegetation. This latter result is promising for the use of such a procedure in regions that cannot be seen directly from orthophotos or satellite images. The proposed method can actively capture the alteration produced by road networks on surface morphology identifying different signatures of urban development: exploration and densification networks that are responsible for increasing the local density of the network and expanding the network into new areas, respectively. The effects of this alteration on surface processes could be significant for future research, creating new questions about differences due to human or landscape forcing on Earth surface processes.},

abstract = {The Anthropocene is proposed as a new interval of geological time in which human influence on Earth and its geological record dominates over natural processes. A major challenge in demarcating the Anthropocene is that the balance between human-influenced and natural processes varies over spatial and temporal scales owing to the inherent variability of both human activities (as associated with culture and modes of development) and natural drivers (e.g. tectonic activity and sea level variation). Against this backdrop, we consider how geomorphology might contribute towards the Anthropocene debate focussing on human impact on aeolian, fluvial, cryospheric and coastal process domains, and how evidence of this impact is preserved in landforms and sedimentary records. We also consider the evidence for an explicitly anthropogenic geomorphology that includes artificial slopes and other human-created landforms. This provides the basis for discussing the theoretical and practical contributions that geomorphology can make to defining an Anthropocene stratigraphy. It is clear that the relevance of the Anthropocene concept varies considerably amongst different branches of geomorphology, depending on the history of human actions in different process domains. For example, evidence of human dominance is more widespread in fluvial and coastal records than in aeolian and cryospheric records, so geomorphologically the Anthropocene would inevitably comprise a highly diachronous lower boundary. Even to identify this lower boundary, research would need to focus on the disambiguation of human effects on geomorphological and sedimentological signatures. This would require robust data, derived from a combination of modelling and new empirical work rather than an arbitrary ‘war of possible boundaries' associated with convenient, but disputed, `golden spikes'. Rather than being drawn into stratigraphical debates, the primary concern of geomorphology should be with the investigation of processes and landform development, so providing the underpinning science for the study of this time of critical geological transition.},

Through his work, he has made fundamental contributions to basic fluvial theory, to the understanding of human impacts on river systems, and to policy-relevant science. He has demonstrated by example how to pursue policy-relevant science and to participate in science-based policy formulation. His contributions to river science can be classified into several themes: (1) the hydrology and geomorphology of suburban drainage systems, (2) riparian vegetation and river systems, (3) the spatial structure and dynamics of incised channels, (4) the dynamics of dryland river systems, (5) heavy metals in river systems, (6) dams and dam removal, and (7) water and public policy. The papers in this special issue reflect many aspects of these themes and address topics related to (1) the understanding of rivers and other geomorphic systems in the midst of dynamic physical change, (2) human influences on geomorphic processes, (3) the intersection of geomorphology and public policy, and (4) the fusion of geomorphic analysis and GIScience.},

abstract = {Humans have become major geomorphological agents, effecting substantial change in the characteristics of Earth's physical landscapes. The agricultural Midwest of the United States is a region marked by pronounced human influence at the landscape scale. Humans undoubtedly have strongly influenced critical zone processes, including fluvial processes, in intensively managed agricultural landscapes, yet the exact nature of human alteration of these processes is unknown. This study documents historical changes in the extent of the stream channel network and in channel planform within the upper Sangamon River basin - an intensively managed agricultural watershed in Illinois. Results indicate that the modern channel network is nearly three times more extensive than the channel network in the 1820s. Most change in drainage density has occurred in headwater portions of the basin where numerous drainage ditches have been added to the network to drain flat uplands. No detectable change in channel position is evident between 1940 and 2012 along about 60{\%} of the total length of the Sangamon River and its major tributaries. Nearly 30{\%} of the total length exhibits change related to meander dynamics (cutoffs and lateral migration), whereas about 8{\%} has changed as a result of channelization. Channelized sections typically remain straight for decades following human modification, supporting the notion that humans produce long-lasting catastrophic change in channel planform in this region. The findings confirm that humans are effective agents of morphological change in fluvial systems in this intensively managed watershed. Documenting human-induced versus natural changes in fluvial systems is important for evaluating how other critical zone processes in intensively managed landscapes have been affected by these changes. Human-induced changes in channel extent and planform most likely have altered this landscape from one dominated by biogeochemical transformations and storage of water and sediment prior to agricultural development into one now characterized by enhanced fluxes of water, sediment, and nutrients.},

abstract = {Using a natural gradient of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) source and concentration in rivers of northern Florida, we investigated how terrestrially-derived DOC affects denitrification rates in river sediments. Specifically, we examined if the higher concentrations of DOC in blackwater rivers stimulate denitrification, or whether such terrestrially-derived DOC supports lower denitrification rates because (1) it is less labile than DOC from aquatic primary production; whether (2) terrestrial DOC directly inhibits denitrification via biochemical mechanisms; and/or whether (3) terrestrial DOC indirectly inhibits denitrification via reduced light availability to—and thus DOC exudation by—aquatic primary producers. We differentiated among these mechanisms using laboratory denitrification assays that subjected river sediments to factorial amendments of NO3 − and dextrose, humic acid dosing, and cross-incubations of sediments and water from different river sources. DOC from terrestrial sources neither depressed nor stimulated denitrification rates, indicating low lability of this DOC but no direct inhibition; humic acid additions similarly did not affect denitrification rates. However, responses to addition of labile C increased with long-term average DOC concentration, which supports the hypothesis that terrestrial DOC indirectly inhibits denitrification via decreased autochthonous production. Observed and future changes in DOC concentration may therefore reduce the ability of inland waterways to remove reactive nitrogen.},

abstract = {Variation in the foliar chemistry of humid tropical forests is poorly understood, and airborne imaging spectroscopy could provide useful information at leaf and canopy scales. However, variation in canopy structure affects our ability to estimate foliar properties from airborne spectrometer data, yet these structural affects remain poorly quantified. Using leaf spectral (400-2500 nm) and chemical data collected from 162 Australian tropical forest species, along with partial least squares (PLS) analysis and canopy radiative transfer modeling, we determined the strength of the relationship between canopy reflectance and foliar properties under conditions of varying canopy structure. At the leaf level, chlorophylls, carotenoids and specific leaf area (SLA) were highly correlated with leaf spectral reflectance (r = 0.90-0.91). Foliar nutrients and water were also well represented by the leaf spectra (r = 0.79-0.85). When the leaf spectra were incorporated into the canopy radiative transfer simulations with an idealistic leaf area index (LAI) = 5.0, correlations between canopy reflectance spectra and leaf properties increased in strength by 4-18{\%}. The effects of random LAI (= 3.0-6.5) variation on the retrieval of leaf properties remained minimal, particularly for pigments and SLA (r = 0.92-0.93). In contrast, correlations between leaf nitrogen (N) and canopy reflectance estimates decreased from r = 0.87 at constant LAI = 5 to r = 0.65 with randomly varying LAI = 3.0-6.5. Progressive increases in the structural variability among simulated tree crowns had relatively little effect on pigment, SLA and water predictions. However, N and phosphorus (P) were more sensitive to canopy structural variability. Our modeling results suggest that multiple leaf chemicals and SLA can be estimated from leaf and canopy reflectance spectroscopy, and that the high-LAI canopies found in tropical forests enhance the signal via multiple scattering. Finally, the two factors we found to most negatively impact leaf chemical predictions from canopy reflectance were variation in LAI and viewing geometry, which can be managed with new airborne technologies and analytical methods. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

While subtle interactions between the Earths orbit, ocean circulation, and the biosphere have dominated climate feedbacks for eons, now human perturbations to the cycles of CO2, other trace gases, and aerosols regulate the pace of climate change. Accompanying the biogeochemical perturbations are the vast changes resulting from biodiversity loss and a profound rearrangement of the biosphere due to species movements and invasions.

The ensemble approach was tested using one artificial and five measured data sets of leaf level spectra and corresponding information on leaf chlorophyll, dry matter, and water content. PLSR models optimized for the goodness of fit, an established approach for band selection, were used to evaluate the performance of the ensemble. Although the fits of the models within the ensemble were poorer than the fits achieved with the reference approach, the ensemble was able to provide a band selection with higher consistency across all data sets. Due to the selection characteristics of the methods within the ensemble, the ensemble selection is moderately narrow and restrictive but in good agreement with known absorption features published in literature. We conclude that analyzing the range of agreement of different model types is an efficient way to select a robust set of spectral bands related to the foliar properties under investigation. This may help to deepen our understanding of the spectral response of biochemical and biophysical traits in foliage and canopies.},

abstract = {Remote identification and mapping of canopy tree species can contribute valuable information towards our understanding of ecosystem biodiversity and function over large spatial scales. However, the extreme challenges posed by highly diverse, closed-canopy tropical forests have prevented automated remote species mapping of non-flowering tree crowns in these ecosystems. We set out to identify individuals of three focal canopy tree species amongst a diverse background of tree and liana species on Barro Colorado Island, Panama, using airborne imaging spectroscopy data. First, we compared two leading single-class classification methods—binary support vector machine (SVM) and biased SVM—for their performance in identifying pixels of a single focal species. From this comparison we determined that biased SVM was more precise and created a multi-species classification model by combining the three biased SVM models. This model was applied to the imagery to identify pixels belonging to the three focal species and the prediction results were then processed to create a map of focal species crown objects. Crown-level cross-validation of the training data indicated that the multi-species classification model had pixel-level producer's accuracies of 94–97{\%} for the three focal species, and field validation of the predicted crown objects indicated that these had user's accuracies of 94–100{\%}. Our results demonstrate the ability of high spatial and spectral resolution remote sensing to accurately detect non-flowering crowns of focal species within a diverse tropical forest. We attribute the success of our model to recent classification and mapping techniques adapted to species detection in diverse closed-canopy forests, which can pave the way for remote species mapping in a wider variety of ecosystems.},

abstract = {To understand role of biogeochemical reactions in controlling the amount and molecular form of dissolved carbon exported from carbonate terrains, spatiotemporal variations in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) were observed over one year in the Santa Fe River system, a period of base flow or below. A water mixing model developed using concentrations of Na+, Cl-, and SO (4) (-2) identified three major water sources: soil water, groundwater and deep aquifer water. After accounting for mixing of these water sources, additional chemical signatures resulting from biogeochemical processes in the riparian zone were identified. Net mineralization of DOC occurred throughout the Santa Fe River watershed, particularly during the lowest flow conditions and in the upper watershed. However, natural dissolved organic matter was more labile during low flow and in the lower watershed, and predominantly derived from groundwater (rather than soil water) in all samples, likely via releases during carbonate dissolution. Carbonate dissolution commonly occurred in the upper watershed during low flow conditions, while carbonate minerals precipitated during baseflow, as well as in the lower watershed during very low flow conditions. Thus, riparian zone biogeochemical processes were strongly mediated by watershed hydrology, whose spatiotemporal variations resulted in greater inorganic and organic C export production in the lower watershed than the upper watershed, and during higher flow versus lower flow periods. During this lower flow period, the Santa Fe River watershed exported similar to 1.0 and 10.3 ton km(-2) year(-1) DOC and DIC, respectively, representing higher C yields than many other types of watersheds.},

abstract = {Airborne hyperspectral data and airborne laserscan or LIDAR data were applied to analyse the sediment transport and the beach morphodynamics along the Belgian shoreline. Between 2000 and 2004, four airborne acquisitions were performed with both types of sensor. The hyperspectral data were classified into seven sand type classes following a supervised classification approach, in which feature selection served to reduce the number of bands in the hyperspectral data. The seven classes allowed us to analyse the spatial dynamics of specific sediment volumes. The technique made it possible to distinguish the sand used for berm replenishment works or for beach nourishments from the sand naturally found on the backshore and the foreshore. Subtracting sequential DTMs (digital terrain models) resulted in height difference maps indicating the erosion and accretion zones. The combination of both data types, hyperspectral data and LIDAR data, provides a powerful tool, suited to analyse the dynamics of sandy shorelines. The technique was demonstrated on three sites along the Belgian shoreline: Koksijde, located on the West Coast and characterized by wide accretional beaches, influenced by dry berm replenishment works and the construction of groins; Zeebrugge, on the Middle Coast, where a beach nourishment was executed one year before the acquisitions started and where the dams of the harbour of Zeebrugge are responsible for the formation of a large accretional beach, and Knokke-Heist, located on the East Coast and characterized by narrow, locally reflective, beaches, heavily influenced by nourishment activities. The methodology applied allowed retrieval of the main sediment transport directions as well as the amount of sediment transported. It proved to be specifically suited to follow up the redistribution and the re-sorting of the fill in beach nourishment areas. and cessation of mass failure and fluvial erosion episodes, (ii) the contributions to total bank retreat made by specific fluvial erosion and mass-wasting processes, and (iii) the causes of retreat. The results show that the occurrence of bank erosion processes (fluvial erosion, slide failure, cantilever failure) and their relative dominance differ significantly for each event, depending on seasonal hydrological conditions and initial bank geometry. Due to the specific planimetric configuration of the study bend, which steers the core of high velocity fluid away from the bank at higher flow discharges, fluvial erosion tends to occur during particular phases of the hydrograph. As a result fluvial erosion is ineffective at higher peak discharges, and depends more on the duration of more moderate discharges. Slide failures appear to be closely related to the magnitude of peak river stages, typically occurring in close proximity to the peak phase (preferentially during the falling limb, but in some cases even before the peak), while cantilever failures more typically occur in the late phase of the flow hydrograph, when they may be induced by the cumulative effects of any fluvial erosion.},

The spectranomics approach, which explicitly connects phylogenetic, chemical and spectral patterns in tropical canopies, provided the basis for analysis. • Intracrown and intraspecific variation in chemical traits varied from 1.4 to 36.7{\%} (median 9.3{\%}), depending upon the chemical constituent. Principal components analysis showed that 14 orthogonal combinations were required to explain 95{\%} of the variation among 21 traits, indicating the high dimensionality of canopy chemical signatures among taxa. Inceptisols and lianas were associated with high leaf nutrient concentrations and low concentrations of defense compounds. Independent of soils or plant habit, an average 70{\%} (maximum 89{\%}) of chemical trait variation was explained by taxonomy. At least 10 traits were quantitatively linked to remotely sensed signatures, which provided highly accurate species classification. • The results suggest that taxa found on fertile soils carry chemical portfolios with a deep evolutionary history, whereas taxa found on low-fertility soils have undergone trait evolution at the species level. Spectranomics provides a new connection between remote sensing and community assembly theory in high-diversity tropical canopies.},

Improvements in analytical technology, for example Fourier-transform ion cyclotron (FT-ICR) mass spectrometry (MS), homo and hetero-correlated multidimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and excitation emission matrix fluorimetry (EEMF) with parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis for UV-fluorescence spectroscopy have resulted in these advances. Improved purification methods, for example ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis, have enabled facile desalting and concentration of freshly collected DOM samples, thereby complementing the analytical process. Although its molecular weight (MW) remains undefined, DOM is described as a complex mixture of low-MW substances and larger-MW biomolecules, for example proteins, polysaccharides, and exocellular macromolecules. There is a general consensus that marine DOM originates from terrestrial and marine sources. A combination of diagenetic and microbial processes contributes to its origin, resulting in refractory organic matter which acts as carbon sink in the ocean. Ocean DOM is derived partially from humified products of plants decay dissolved in fresh water and transported to the ocean, and partially from proteinaceous and polysaccharide material from phytoplankton metabolism, which undergoes in-situ microbial processes, becoming refractory. Some of the DOM interacts with radiation and is, therefore, defined as chromophoric DOM (CDOM). CDOM is classified as terrestrial, marine, anthropogenic, or mixed, depending on its origin. Terrestrial CDOM reaches the oceans via estuaries, whereas autochthonous CDOM is formed in sea water by microbial activity; anthropogenic CDOM is a result of human activity. CDOM also affects the quality of water, by shielding it from solar radiation, and constitutes a carbon sink pool. Evidence in support of the hypothesis that part of marine DOM is of terrestrial origin, being the result of a long-term carbon sedimentation, has been obtained from several studies discussed herein.},

abstract = {Transitions from grassland to shrubland through woody plant encroachment result in potentially significant shifts in savanna ecosystem function. Given high resolution imagery, a textural index could prove useful for mapping woody plant densities and monitoring woody plant encroachment across savanna landscapes. Spatial heterogeneity introduced through mixtures of herbaceous and woody plants challenges quantitative assessments of changing woody plant density using remotely sensed imagery. Moreover, woody plant encroachment occurs across decadal time scales, restricting remote sensing analyses to historical aerial photograph records. Heterogeneity in vegetation structure has a significant influence on local pixel variance in high resolution images. We scanned black and white aerial photographs for 18 sites of varying woody plant density, producing images of 2-m grain size. Omnidirectional variograms derived from these images had ranges of approximately 10 m and sills highly sensitive to woody plant density, prompting us to use a textural index to indicate landscape variation in woody plant density. For validation purposes, we measured several woody overstory structural parameters in the field; a factor analysis revealed woody stem count as the best correlate with image texture. Significance of the regression of image texture on woody stem count declined as grain size of the 2-m images was coarsened to simulate that of SPOT and Landsat satellite sensors. At 10-m resolution, our textural index proved a significant indicator of woody plant density. We mosaicked sequential aerial photographs scanned at 10-m resolution and then applied our textural filter, producing maps of historical woody plant distribution that reflected patterns in soil and vegetation type. More accurate maps of canopy structure and structural change are needed to explore potential effects of woody plant encroachment on biophysical and biogeochemical processes at large scales.},

abstract = {Because freshwater covers such a small fraction of the Earth's surface area, inland freshwater ecosystems (particularly lakes, rivers, and reservoirs) have rarely been considered as potentially important quantitative components of the carbon cycle at either global or regional scales. By taking published estimates of gas exchange, sediment accumulation, and carbon transport for a variety of aquatic systems, we have constructed a budget for the role of inland water ecosystems in the global carbon cycle. Our analysis conservatively estimates that inland waters annually receive, from a combination of background and anthropogenically altered sources, on the order of 1.9 Pg C y−1 from the terrestrial landscape, of which about 0.2 is buried in aquatic sediments, at least 0.8 (possibly much more) is returned to the atmosphere as gas exchange while the remaining 0.9 Pg y−1 is delivered to the oceans, roughly equally as inorganic and organic carbon. Thus, roughly twice as much C enters inland aquatic systems from land as is exported from land to the sea. Over prolonged time net carbon fluxes in aquatic systems tend to be greater per unit area than in much of the surrounding land. Although their area is small, these freshwater aquatic systems can affect regional C balances. Further, the inclusion of inland, freshwater ecosystems provides useful insight about the storage, oxidation and transport of terrestrial C, and may warrant a revision of how the modern net C sink on land is described.},

abstract = {From headwater to mouth, the physical variables within a river system present a continuous gradient of physical conditions. This gradient should elicit a series of responses within the constituent populations resulting in a continuum of biotic adjustments and consistent patterns of loading, transport, utilization, and storage of roganic matter along the length of a river. Based on the energy equilibrium theory of fluvial geomorphologists, we hypothesize that the structural and functional characterristics of stream communities are adapted to conform to the most profitable position or mean state of the physical system. We reason that producer and consumer characteristic of a givevn river reach become established in harmony with the dymanic physical conditions of that channel. In natural stream systems, biological communities can be characterized as forming a temporal continuum of synchronized species replacements. This continuous replacement functions to distribute the utilization of energy inputs over time. Thus, the biological system moves towards a balance between a tendency for efficient use of enery inputs through resource partitioning (foor, substrate, etc) and an opposing tendency for a uniform rate of enery processing throughout the year. We theorize that biological communities developed in natural streams assume processing strategies involving minium energy loss. Downstream communities are fashioned to capitalize on upstream processing inefficiencies. Both upstream inefficiency (leakage) and the downstream adjustments seem predictable. We propose that this Rivier Continuum Concept provides a framework for integrating predictable and observable biological features of lotic systems. Impliations of the concept in the areas of structure, function, and stability of riverine ecosystems are discussed.},

By combining multiple sensors into one platform, we were able to detect terrestrial-aquatic hydrologic connections in a small dystrophic lake, to infer the role of main-channel vs backwater nutrient processing in a large river and to detect sharp chemical changes across aquatic ecosystem boundaries in a stream/lake complex. Spatial sensor data were verified in our examples by comparing with standard lab-based measurements of selected variables. Spatial fDOM data showed strong correlation with wet chemistry measurements of DOC, and optical NO3 concentrations were highly correlated with lab-based measurements. High-frequency spatial data similar to our examples could be used to further understand aquatic biogeochemical fluxes, ecological patterns, and ecosystem processes, and will both inform and benefit from fixed-site data.},

abstract = {We explore the role of lakes in carbon cycling and global climate, examine the mechanisms influencing carbon pools and transformations in lakes, and discuss how the metabolism of carbon in the inland waters is likely to change in response to climate. Furthermore, we project changes as global climate change in the abundance and spatial distribution of lakes in the biosphere, and we revise the estimate for the global extent of carbon transformation in inland waters. This synthesis demonstrates that the global annual emissions of carbon dioxide from inland waters to the atmosphere are similar in magnitude to the carbon dioxide uptake by the oceans and that the global burial of organic carbon in inland water sediments exceeds organic carbon sequestration on the ocean floor. The role of inland waters in global carbon cycling and climate forcing may be changed by human activities, including construction of impoundments, which accumulate large amounts of carbon in sediments and emit large amounts of methane to the atmosphere. Methane emissions are also expected from lakes on melting permafrost. The synthesis presented here indicates that (1) inland waters constitute a significant component of the global carbon cycle, (2) their contribution to this cycle has significantly changed as a result of human activities, and (3) they will continue to change in response to future climate change causing decreased as well as increased abundance of lakes as well as increases in the number of aquatic impoundments.},

abstract = {Characterization of the rate of water migration through unsaturated mine waste rock dumps is an essential element in assessing the chemical loading from these landforms; yet our understanding of how water moves into, through and out of waste rock is incomplete. To further understand the rates and magnitude of percolation through waste rock, deep high-resolution (every 0.1-4.5 m) depth profiles of the stable isotopes of water ($\delta$2H and $\delta$18O) at two coal waste rock dumps and a natural alluvial deposit down-gradient of one of the dumps were collected in the Elk Valley, British Columbia, Canada. The profiles were generated using vapor equilibrium techniques applied to continuous core samples collected using dry sonic drilling methods. Elevated core temperatures (up to 80 °C) were measured during sonic coring. The isotopic values of pore waters measured in the core samples were corrected for water loss to the atmosphere attributed to the elevated core temperatures. The average isotopic composition of the core samples were compared to water collected from rock drains discharging from the base of the dumps. The results indicate that high-resolution profiles of $\delta$2H and $\delta$18O can be measured to depths of 86 m in coal waste rock dumps and, based on the seasonal cycles in the isotopic composition of recharging water, can be used to characterize the migration of recharge water within these dumps. These profiles also suggest that recharge into these dumps occurs from both rain as well as snow melt and may be as high as 400-600 mm/yr (60-75{\%} of annual precipitation). Combined with the relatively low volumetric water contents of these dumps (5-10{\%}) the rates of water migration through the dumps are tens of meters each year.},

@article{Hilton2014,
abstract = {Oxidation of rock-derived, petrogenic, organic carbon (OCpetro) during weathering of sedimentary rocks is a major source of carbon dioxide (CO2) to the atmosphere. This geological respiration is thought to be enhanced by physical erosion, suggesting that mountain belts could release large amounts of CO2 to counter the CO2 sequestration achieved by the erosion, riverine transfer and oceanic burial of organic carbon from the terrestrial biosphere. However, OCpetro oxidation rates in mountain belts have not been quantified. Here we use rhenium (Re) as a proxy to track OCpetro oxidation in mountain river catchments of Taiwan, where existing measurements of physical erosion rate allow the controls on OCpetro oxidation to be assessed. Re has been shown to be closely associated with OCpetro in rocks and following oxidation during chemical weathering forms a soluble oxyanion (ReO4-) which contributes to the dissolved load of rivers. Soils on meta-sedimentary rocks in Taiwan show that Re loss is coupled to OCpetro loss during weathering, confirming previous observations from soil profiles on sedimentary rocks elsewhere. In Taiwan rivers, dissolved Re flux increases with the catchment-average sediment yield, suggesting that physical erosion rate is a major control on OCpetro oxidation. Based on our current understanding of Re mobility during weathering, the dissolved Re flux can be used to quantify an upper bound on the OCpetro oxidation rate and the associated CO2 transfer. The estimated CO2 release from this mountain belt by OCpetro oxidation does not negate estimates of CO2 sequestration by burial of biospheric OC offshore. The findings are compared to OC transfers estimated for the Himalaya, where OCpetro oxidation in the mountain belt remains unconstrained. Together, these cases suggest that mountain building in the tropics can result in a net sink of OC which sequesters atmospheric CO2. {\textcopyright} 2014.},

These rates, coupled with previously measured physical erosion yields, allow us to compare these two modes of landscape denudation. The physical erosion yields are some of the highest measured in the world. Although in most instances the chemical erosion yields are only a small fraction of the total erosion yields, the absolute values are very high. Our data strongly support the notion that chemical erosion rates are greatly influenced by the yield of physical erosion and that the rapid production of fresh surfaces as a result of high physical erosion rates and subsequent denudation is critical to the high chemical erosion yields observed.},

abstract = {Sediment fluxes from high standing oceanic islands (HSIs) such as New Zealand are some of the highest known [Milliman J. D. and Syvitski J. P. M. (1992) Geomorphic/tectonic control of sediment discharge to the ocean: the importance of small mountainous rivers. J. Geol. 100, 525-544]. Recent geochemical work has suggested that along with their extremely high physical weathering yields, many New Zealand watersheds also have very high chemical weathering yields. In New Zealand, the magnitude of both the physical and chemical weathering yields is related to the lithology of the watershed. Most of the previous work on this topic has been undertaken in Southern Alps watersheds of schist and greywacke and in East Cape watersheds of semi-consolidated marine sediments and greywacke. We recently sampled North Island watersheds in the Taranaki and Manawatu-Wanganui regions which have been subjected to volcanism since the Miocene. We sampled watersheds that contain both volcanic and sedimentary rocks. A series of water and sediment samples was collected and analyzed for major, minor and trace elements. This was done to quantify the weathering intensities in the watersheds and to establish the relationship between physical and chemical weathering yields in volcanic lithologies. Our results reveal distinct chemical signatures for the different regions. Waters draining the Taranaki region volcanics are significantly enriched in K+, and depleted in Ca2+ and Sr2+ compared to waters draining the Manawatu-Wanganui region volcanics, which also traverse expanses of sedimentary siltstones and mudstones. The Ca2+ and Sr2+ depletions may reflect the relative absence of CaCO3 in the Taranaki region watersheds. In addition, sediment samples from the Taranaki region show significant enrichment in Ti, Al, Ca, Fe, Mn, Mg, Ca, and P and depletion in Si and Rb compared to those of the Manawatu-Wanganui region. From total dissolved solids concentrations and mean annual water discharge, we calculate chemical weathering yields of 60-240 tons km-2 a-1. These weathering yields fall within the middle to upper range of those previously documented for the Southern Alps (93-480 tons km-2 a-1) and East Cape (62-400 tons km-2 a-1). Calculated silicate weathering yields of 12-33.6 tons km-2 a-1 and CO2 consumption of 852-2390 ?? 103 mol km-2 a-1 for the rivers draining the Taranaki volcanic region are higher than those previously reported for watersheds hosted in sedimentary and metamorphosed rock terrains on HSIs. CO2 consumption is found to be within the range previously measured for the basaltic terrains of the Deccan Traps (580-2450 ?? 103 mol km-2 a-1) and R??union Island(1300-4400 ?? 103 mol km-2 a-1). Our calculated chemical weathering yields demonstrate the importance of HSIs, particularly those with volcanic terrains, when considering global geochemical fluxes. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Chemical weathering activity in the South Cascade Glacier area of the Northern Cascades is both intensive and extensive. The presence of chemical weathering is shown by (1) pedogenic clay assemblages which vary according to bedrock mineralogy, (2) distinctive water types which co-exist with discrete bedrock types and (3) the striking chemical transformation of water as it runs over bedrock. The weathering mechanisms are primarily carbonation and oxidation. Even though zoned soils are rare or absent, pedogenic minerals such as vermiculite, smectite, gibbsite and lepidocrocite accumulate locally. Cationic denudation of the South Cascade Glacier watershed (930 mE/m2yr) is substantially higher than the world average (390 mE/m2yr), indicating the intensity of chemical weathering in such an environment. Evidently the low average temperatures generally associated with an active glacier do not inhibit chemical weathering reactions. On the contrary, the turbulent well-aerated water flows prevalent in such an environment promote weathering by constantly replenishing the acid potential of the water. Also, the mechanical effects of glaciation apparently expedite the chemical weathering process by continuously reviving the fresh surface area of rock exposed to water. A crucial limiting factor in chemical weathering seems to be the supply of water and hydrogen ion from the atmosphere. By virtue of the fact that the temperate glacial environment represents an extreme of hydrologic activity, it may, therefore, represent an extreme of chemical weathering activity even in the absence of normal biologic and pedogenic processes associated with the soil. ?? 1972.},

abstract = {Climatic effects on chemical weathering are evaluated by correlating variations On solute concentrations and fluxes with temperature, precipitation, runoff, and evapotranspiration (ET) for a worldwide distribution of sixty-eight watersheds underlain by granitoid rock types. Stream solute concentrations are strongly correlated with proportional ET loss, and evaporative concentration makes stream solute concentrations an inappropriate surrogate for chemical weathering. Chemical fluxes are unaffected by ET, and SiO2 and Na weathering fluxes exhibit systematic increases with precipitation, runoff, and temperature. However, warm and wet watersheds produce anomalously rapid weathering rates. A proposed model that provides an improved prediction of weathering rates over climatic extremes Os the product of linear precipitation and Arrhenius temperature functions. The resulting apparent activation energies based on SiO2 and Na fluxes are 59.4 and 62.5 kJ ?? mol-1, respectively. The coupling between temperature and precipitation emphasizes the importance of tropical regions On global silicate weathering fluxes, and suggests it is not representative to use continental averages for temperature and precipitation On the weathering rate functions of global carbon cycling and climatic change models. Fluxes of K, Ca, and Mg exhibit no climatic correlation, implying that other processes, such as ion exchange, nutrient cycling, and variations On lithology, obscure any climatic signal. The correlation between yearly variations On precipitation and solute fluxes within individual watersheds Os stronger than the correlation between precipitation and solute fluxes of watersheds with different climatic regimes. This underscores the significance of transport-induced variability On controlling stream chemistry, and the importance of distinguishing between short-term and long-term climatic trends. No correlation exists between chemical fluxes and topographic relief or the extent of recent glaciation, implying that physical erosion rates do not have a critical influence on chemical weathering rates. ?? 1995.},

To explain variations in the strength of the weathering feedback, we present a model for silicate weathering that regulates climatic and tectonic forcing through hydrologic processes and imposes a thermodynamic limit on weathering fluxes, based on the physical and chemical properties of river basins. Climate regulation by silicate weathering is thus strongest when global topography is elevated, similar to the situation today, and lowest when global topography is more subdued, allowing planetary temperatures to vary depending on the global distribution of topography and mountain belts, even in the absence of appreciable changes in CO2 degassing rates.},

abstract = {Climatic effects on chemical weathering are evaluated by correlating variations in solute concentrations and fluxes with temperature, precipitation, runoff, and evapotranspiration( ET) for a worldwide distribution of sixty-eight watersheds underlain by granitoid rock types. Stream solute concentrations are strongly correlated with proportional ET loss, and evaporative concentration makes stream solute concentrations an inappropriate surrogate for chemical weathering. Chemical fluxes are unaffected by ET, and SiO2 and Na weathering fluxes exhibit systematic increases with precipitation, runoff, and temperature. However, warm and wet watersheds produce anomalously rapid weathering rates. A proposed model that provides an improved prediction of weathering rates over climatic extremes is the product of linear precipitation and Arrhenius temperature functions. The resulting apparent activation energies based on SiO2 and Na fluxes are 59.4 and 62.5 kJ . mol(-1), respectively. The coupling between temperature and precipitation emphasizes the importance of tropical regions in global silicate weathering fluxes, and suggests it is not representative to use continental averages for temperature and precipitation in the weathering rate functions of global carbon cycling and climatic change models. Fluxes of Ii, Ca, and Mg exhibit no climatic correlation, implying that other processes, such as ion exchange, nutrient cycling, and variations in lithology, obscure any climatic signal. The correlation between yearly variations in precipitation and solute fluxes within individual watersheds is stronger than the correlation between precipitation and solute fluxes of watersheds with different climatic regimes. This underscores the significance of transport-induced variability in controlling stream chemistry, and the importance of distinguishing between short-term and long-term climatic trends. No correlation exists between chemical fluxes acid topographic relief or the extent of recent glaciation, implying that physical erosion rates do not have a critical influence on chemical weathering rates.},

abstract = {This study investigates dissolved, suspended loads and sands of major Icelandic rivers and determines chemical and mechanical erosion rates as well as rates of CO2 consumption by the chemical weathering. A steady state model of erosion is used to locally calculate the river suspended load fluxes needed to balance chemical weathering.  The total dissolved solid concentrations range from 20 to 179 mg/kg. The highest concentrations are for spring fed rivers draining young rocks in the vicinity of active volcanoes, and the lowest for direct runoff rivers draining old Tertiary rocks. Total dissolved loads, "corrected" for atmospheric, geothermal, and magmatic inputs are used together with mean annual discharges to estimate low-temperature chemical erosion rates of 16 to 111 t/km2/yr. These rates increase with runoff but decrease with the age of the rocks. Icelandic chemical erosion rates are higher than the world average for silicate rocks, reflecting both high reactivity of the basalt and high runoff, but lower than those for other basalt-draining rivers (in R{\'{e}}union, Java, Azores or Deccan). CO2 consumption rates associated to chemical denudation range between 0.18 and 2.12 106 mol/km2/yr with an average value of 0.74 106 mol/km2/yr, higher than the world average for rivers draining silicate rocks.  Chemical compositions of suspended sediments and sands are similar, showing a very low weathering stage. The elements most soluble during the weathering show slightly lower concentrations in the suspended sediments. River sediment chemical compositions are assumed to reflect a mixture between 3 initially pristine rock end-members: high Mg-basalt, tholeiite and rhyolite. The most insoluble elements (REE and Th) are used to re-define the mean chemical composition of the initially unaltered rocks of each drainage basin.  A mass budget between the unaltered rock of the catchments and the river dissolved and suspended loads (steady state model of erosion) is used to calculate the average annual solid load of the rivers, which range from 650 to 4300 mg/l. For some rivers there is a good agreement between calculated and measured suspended loads but for others the calculated load is much higher than the measured one. The difference stems from groundwater inputs, man-made dams and other sedimentary traps. If the relevancy of the steady state model of erosion can be questioned, the accuracy of sediment load measurements is also questionable. Pros and cons of both methods are argued. The calculated solid loads lead to very high mechanical erosion rates, ranging from 940 to 10200 t/km2/yr. Those increase with the glacier cover but decrease with the age of the catchment rocks. Icelandic mechanical erosion rates rank among the maximum reported rates, underscoring the importance of glaciers, tectonics, glassy basaltic rocks and high runoff. In association with low chemical weathering rates, these place Icelandic rivers as an end-member in the observed anti-correlation between mechanical to chemical erosion ratios and temperature for volcanic islands.},

abstract = {Valley fill mining has the potential to alter headwater stream habitat in many areas in the eastern United States. In valley fill mining, overburden is removed to expose underlying coal seams. The overburden is then deposited in the adjacent valley. The deposited overburden from mining increases sedimentation, increases stream conductivity, and alters hydrologic regimes downstream of the fill. Changes in downstream communities are not well documented. However, it was suspected the increased sedimentation and conductivity would have deleterious effects upon the downstream macroinvertebrate communities. In southern West Virginia, four pairs of streams, each consisting of a fill and a reference stream, were selected as representative of watersheds experiencing valley fill mining. Stream pairs were selected for similar environmental conditions, with one stream having a valley fill in its headwaters. Each stream was sampled by replicate Surber samples ( = 9 per stream). Water chemistry and sediment measurements also were taken at each location. Valley fill streams experienced significantly higher specific conductance (p {\textless} 0.01), but did not have elevated levels of fine sediment. Fills exhibited elevated levels of Na, K, Mn, Mg, Ca, Ni and Fe relative to reference streams. Additionally, valley fill streams demonstrated significantly lower densities of Ephemeroptera, Coleoptera, Odonata, Non-insects, Scrapers, and Shredders (p {\textless} 0.03) than reference streams. Further, Ephemeroptera richness was negatively related to specific conductivity and many of the richness metrics were negatively related to metals, both of which were generally elevated in fill streams. It appears that at the minimum, valley fills increase specific conductance and metals in streams and this or some other unqualified factors structure the macroinvertebrate community downstream of the valley fill. However, given the level of disturbance in valley fills, it is surprising how little differences existed between fills and reference stream biota.},

@article{Adams2007,
abstract = {In 1989, a watershed acidification experi- ment was begun on the Fernow Experimental Forest in West Virginia, USA. Ammonium sulfate fertilizer (35.5 kg N ha−1 yr−1and 40.5 kg S ha−1 yr−1) was applied to a forested watershed (WS3) that supported a 20-year-old stand of eastern deciduous hardwoods. Additions of N and S are approximately twice the ambient deposition of nitrogen and sulfur in the adjacent mature forested watershed (WS4), that serves as the reference watershed for this study. Acidification of stream water and soil solution was documented, although the response was delayed, and acidification processes appeared to be driven by nitrate rather than sulfate. As a result of the acidification treatment, nitrate solution concentrations increased below all soil layers, whereas sulfate was retained by all soil layers after only a few years of the fertilization treatments, perhaps due to adsorption induced from decreasing sulfate deposition. Based on soil solution monitoring, depletion of calcium and magnesium was observed, first from the upper soil horizons and later from the lower soil horizons. Increased base cation concen- trations in stream water also were documented and linked closely with high solution levels of nitrate.Significant changes in soil chemical properties were not detected after 12 years of treatment, however.},

abstract = {A complete, spatially explicit dataset illustrating the 21st century mining footprint for the conterminous United States does not exist. To address this need, we developed a semi-automated procedure to map the country's mining footprint (30-m pixel) and establish a baseline to monitor changes in mine extent over time. The process uses mine seed points derived from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Mineral Resources Data System (MRDS), and USGS National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD) and recodes patches of barren land that meet a “distance to seed” requirement and a patch area requirement before mapping a pixel as mining. Seed points derived from EIA coal points, an edited MRDS point file, and 1992 NLCD mine points were used in three separate efforts using different distance and patch area parameters for each. The three products were then merged to create a 2001 map of moderate-to-large mines in the United States, which was subsequently manually edited to reduce omission and commission errors. This process was replicated using NLCD 2006 barren pixels as a base layer to create a 2006 mine map and a 2001–2006 mine change map focusing on areas with surface mine expansion. In 2001, 8,324 km2 of surface mines were mapped. The footprint increased to 9,181 km2 in 2006, representing a 10{\textperiodcentered}3{\%} increase over 5 years. These methods exhibit merit as a timely approach to generate wall-to-wall, spatially explicit maps representing the recent extent of a wide range of surface mining activities across the country.

We address three topics relevant to human-landscape systems: (1) scales of human impacts on geomorphic processes, (2) spatial and temporal scales in river restoration, and (3) time scales of natural disasters and behavioral and institutional responses. Studies showing dramatic recent change in sediment yields from uplands to the ocean via rivers illustrate the increasingly vast spatial extent and quick rate of human landscape change in the last two millennia, but especially in the second half of the twentieth century. Recent river restoration efforts are typically small in spatial and temporal scale compared to the historical human changes to ecosystem processes, but the cumulative effectiveness of multiple small restoration projects in achieving large ecosystem goals has yet to be demonstrated. The mismatch between infrequent natural disasters and individual risk perception, media coverage, and institutional response to natural disasters results in un-preparedness and unsustainable land use and building practices.},

abstract = {We describe and apply a point model of the joint evolution of tidal landforms and biota which incorporates the dynamics of intertidal vegetation; benthic microbial assemblages; erosional, depositional, and sediment exchange processes; wind-wave dynamics, and relative sea level change. Alternative stable states and punctuated equilibria emerge, characterized by possible sudden transitions of the system state, governed by vegetation type, disturbances of the benthic biofilm, sediment availability, and marine transgressions or regressions. Multiple stable states are suggested to result from the interplay of erosion, deposition, and biostabilization, providing a simple explanation for the ubiquitous presence of the typical landforms observed in tidal environments worldwide. The main properties of accessible equilibrium states prove robust with respect to specific modeling assumptions and are thus identified as characteristic dynamical features of tidal systems. Halophytic vegetation emerges as a key stabilizing factor through wave dissipation, rather than a major trapping agent, because the total inorganic deposition flux is found to be largely independent of standing biomass under common supply-limited conditions. The organic sediment production associated with halophytic vegetation represents a major contributor to the overall deposition flux, thus critically affecting the ability of salt marshes to keep up with high rates of relative sea level rise. The type and number of available equilibria and the possible shifts among them are jointly driven and controlled by the available suspended sediment, the rate of relative sea level change, and vegetation and microphytobenthos colonization. The explicit description of biotic and abiotic processes thus emerges as a key requirement for realistic and predictive models of the evolution of a tidal system as a whole. The analysis of such coupled processes finally indicates that hysteretic switches between stable states arise because of differences in the threshold values of relative sea level rise inducing transitions from vegetated to unvegetated equilibria and vice versa.},

@article{Gerke1998,
abstract = {The generation of acid mine drainage from overburden spoil piles at open-pit lignite mines is impacting the quality of groundwater and surface water bodies in large parts of the Lusatian mining area in Germany. Values of pH as low as 1 have been observed in the groundwater. After decommissioning, mine pits are generally converted to lakes which may also be acidic owing to the acidic groundwater discharge. The acidic effluent is generated by sulphide oxidation in the unsaturated zone of the spoil pile which generally extends to large depths as a result of dewatering. The long-term evolution of the acidification is still largely unknown. Our research focuses on the effects of physical and chemical heterogeneity caused by mixing of soil materials that may have already been oxidized to different degrees during the deposition of the spoil pile. Processes considered include variably saturated groundwater flow, oxygen diffusion in the soil gas, kinetic pyrite oxidation and acidic effluent generation, advective-dispersive transport of the aqueous components, equilibrium geochemical reactions between the chemical components and the soil minerals, and possible buffering and acid neutralization. Several existing numerical codes were coupled to represent the complete set of processes. Simulations were carried out in one and two dimensions using representative characteristics of mine spoil piles, with the two-dimensional representation being based on spatially heterogeneous random fields of hydraulic conductivity and sulphide mineral fractions. Results show the long-term evolution of the oxidation front, the mass flux of oxidation products and the effects of system heterogeneity. Under conditions of constant flow, the system is found to return to neutral conditions over a time period on the order of several decades. Further work, including sensitivity analyses with respect to the controlling parameters and model calibration using site-specific field data, will be necessary to obtain a full understanding of the complex interacting mechanisms. The simulation approach shows promise as a potentially useful tool for predicting the effects of sulphide oxidation on the water quality of pit lakes.},

abstract = {Changes in water quality over 25 years have been documented for discharges from an extensive network of abandoned underground coal mines in the Uniontown Syncline, Fayette County, PA, USA. A baseline study of 136 mine discharges in the syncline was conducted in 1974–1975. In 1998–2000, follow-up water flow and quality monitoring was conducted at 21 selected discharges for 2 years to assess the degree of mine water-quality improvement since 1974–1975. The data from the two periods of time were compared, with consideration of differences in measurement methods. The degree and rate of water-quality improvement was found to be highly dependent on the amount and duration of flooding in the mine voids. Water quality of discharges from the substantially flooded mine voids improved significantly, going from acidic water with high sulfate and iron concentrations in 1974–1975 to alkaline water with substantially lower sulfate and iron concentrations in 1998–2000. In contrast, the water quality in the unflooded mines showed less improvement over the 25 years between studies. The water discharging from the unflooded mines in 1974–1975 was acidic with high sulfate concentrations and in 1998–2000 was still acidic but showed somewhat lower sulfate and iron concentrations, reflecting depletion of readily available pyrite. The data obtained provide insight into the potential and rate of natural amelioration of mine water quality in different abandoned underground coal mine systems.},

@article{Younger2001,
abstract = {Scotland was one of the world's first industrialised countries, and has therefore also been one of the first countries to experience wholesale post-industrial dereliction. Water pollution arising from abandoned mines, particularly abandoned coal mines, is second only to sewage as a source of freshwater pollution nation-wide, and in many coalfield catchments it is the pre-eminent source. Most of the pollution is due to net-alkaline ferruginous waters emerging from deep mines. Scrutiny of records from 80 deep mine discharges reveals that iron concentrations in these waters are only likely to exceed 20 mg/l, and the pH to be below 6.5, where the discharge emerges within 0.5 km of the outcrop of the shallowest mined seam. The bulk of mature near-outcrop mine water discharges in Scotland have {\textless}50 mg/l total Fe, and concentrations {\textgreater}100 mg/l are only likely where a marine bed lies within 25 m of the worked seam. Where the nearest marine bed is more than 80 m above or below the seam, then the total iron will be less than 4 mg/l, and in most cases less than 1 mg/l. Net-acidic mine waters are far more rare than net-alkaline waters in Scotland, and are most commonly associated with unreclaimed spoil heaps (bings). Both net-alkaline and net-acidic discharges have detrimental effects on the hydrochemistry and biological integrity of receiving waters. Scotland has recently pioneered the use of pre-emptive pump-and-treat solutions to prevent mine water pollution, and has also experienced the successful introduction of passive treatment technology for both abandoned and active workings.

abstract = {Quaternary glacial-interglacial cycles create lasting biogeographic, demographic and genetic effects on ecosystems, yet the ecological effects of ice ages on benthic marine communities are unknown. We analysed long-term datasets to develop a niche-based model of southern Californian giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) forest distribution as a function of oceanography and geomorphology, and synthesized palaeo-oceanographic records to show that late Quaternary climate change probably drove high millennial variability in the distribution and productivity of this foundation species. Our predictions suggest that kelp forest biomass increased up to threefold from the glacial maximum to the mid-Holocene, then rapidly declined by 40-70 per cent to present levels. The peak in kelp forest productivity would have coincided with the earliest coastal archaeological sites in the New World. Similar late Quaternary changes in kelp forest distribution and productivity probably occurred in coastal upwelling systems along active continental margins worldwide, which would have resulted in complex shifts in the relative productivity of terrestrial and marine components of coastal ecosystems.},

abstract = {This paper examines the effect of scale (exhibited by spatial sampling) in modeling mean slope from lidar data using two representations of scale: lidar posting density (i.e. post-spacing) and DEM resolution (i.e. cell size). The study areas selected include six small (i.e. approximately 3{\^{A}} km{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}) urban drainage basins in Richland County, SC, USA, which share similar hydrologic characteristics. This research spatially sampled an airborne lidar dataset collected in 2000 at a 2{\^{A}} m nominal posting density to simulate lidar posting density at various post-spacings, from 2{\^{A}} m through 10{\^{A}} m. DEMs were created from the lidar observations at a corresponding cell size using spatial interpolation. Finally, using these DEMs, a sensitivity analysis between modeled terrain slope and lidar post-spacing was conducted. Results of the sensitivity analyses showed that the deviation between mean slope and modeled mean slope decreases with finer posting density and DEM resolution. The relationship of mean slope with varying cell sizes and post-spacing suggests a linear and a logarithmic function, respectively, for all study areas. More importantly, cell size has a greater effect on mean slope than lidar posting density. Implications of these results for lumped hydrologic modeling are then postulated.},

abstract = {Soil-water potential and hydraulic conductivity relationships with soil-water content are needed for many plant and soil-water studies. Measurement of these relationships is costly, difficult, and often impractical. For many purposes, general estimates based on more readily available information such as soil texture are sufficient. Re- cent studies have developed statistical correlations between soil tex- ture and selected soil potentials using a large data base, and also between selected soil textures and hydraulic conductivity. The ob- jective of this study was to extend these results by providing math- ematical equations for continuous estimates over broad ranges of soil texture, water potentials, and hydraulic conductivities. Results from the recent statistical analyses were used to calculate water potentials for a wide range of soil textures, then these were fit by multivariate analyses to provide continuous potential estimates for all inclusive textures. Similarly, equations were developed for un- saturated hydraulic conductivities for all inclusive textures. While the developed equations only represent a statistical estimate and only the textural influence, they provide quite useful estimates for many usual soil-water cases. The equations provide excellent com- putational efficiency for model applications and the textures can be used as calibration parameters where field or laboratory soil water characteristic data are available. Predicted values were successfully compared with several independent measurements of soil-water po- tential.},

abstract = {The integration of usable and flexible analysis support in modelling environments is a key success factor in Model-Driven Development. In this paradigm, models are the core asset from which code is automatically generated, and thus ensuring model correctness is a fundamental quality control activity. For this purpose, a common approach is to transform the system models into formal semantic domains for verification. However, if the analysis results are not shown in a proper way to the end-user (e.g. in terms of the original language) they may become useless. In this paper we present a novel DSVL called BaVeL that facilitates the flexible annotation of verification results obtained in semantic domains to different formats, including the context of the original language. BaVeL is used in combination with a consistency framework, providing support for all steps in a verification process: acquisition of additional input data, transformation of the system models into semantic domains, verification, and flexible annotation of analysis results. The approach has been validated analytically by the cognitive dimensions framework, and empirically by its implementation and application to several DSVLs. Here we present a case study of a notation in the area of Digital Libraries, where the analysis is performed by transformations into Petri nets and a process algebra. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Stable-isotope ratios of carbon (C-13/C-12 or delta C-13) have been widely used to determine the energy base of stream food webs, but such use is controversial due to unexplained variability in algal delta C-13. I used published delta C-13 data from temperate headwater streams through medium-sized rivers (0.2-4000 km(2) watershed area) collected during summer baseflows and original data from streams in northern California to analyze energy pathways through river food webs. The analyses showed three important results. First, epilithic algal delta C-13 and watershed area are positively related, suggesting that effects of carbon Limitation on algal carbon uptake result in C-13 enrichment of algal delta C-13 in larger, more productive rivers. Second, epilithic algae and terrestrial detritus delta C-13 values are often distinct in small shaded streams but overlap in some larger unshaded streams and rivers. Measurements of delta C-13 values may be most useful in distinguishing algal and terrestrial energy sources in unproductive streams with supersaturated dissolved CO, concentrations, and some productive rivers where CO, concentrations are low relative to photosynthetic rates. Finally, consumer delta C-13 values are more strongly related to algal delta C-13 than terrestrial delta C-13. The relative contribution of terrestrial and algal carbon sources often varied by functional feeding group within and between sites. However, with the exception of shredders and scrapers, which respectively relied on terrestrial and algal carbon sources, patterns of consumer delta C-13 clearly show a transition from terrestrial to algal carbon sources for many lotic food webs in streams with greater than or equal to 10 km(2) watershed area. The observed transition to algal carbon sources is likely related to increasing primary production rates as forest canopy cover declines in larger streams, although decreasing retention or quality of terrestrial carbon may also play a role. Improved analyses of algal delta C-13 and delta N-15 combined with quantitative study of organic matter dynamics and food web structure should allow the relative importance of these factors to be distinguished in future food web studies.},

abstract = {The elemental composition of solutes transported by rivers reflects combined influences of surrounding watersheds and transformations within stream networks, yet comparatively little is known about downstream changes in effects of watershed loading vs. in-channel processes. In the forested watershed of a river under a mediterranean hydrologic regime, we examined the influence of longitudinal changes in environmental conditions on water-column nutrient composition during summer base flow across a network of sites ranging from strongly heterotrophic headwater streams to larger, more autotrophic sites downstream. Small streams (0.1-10 km2 watershed area) had longitudinally similar nutrient concentration and composition with low (approximately 2) dissolved nitrogen (N) to phosphorus (P) ratios. Abrupt deviations from this pattern were observed in larger streams with watershed areas {\textgreater} 100 km2 where insolation and algal abundance and production rapidly increased. Downstream, phosphorus and silica concentrations decreased by {\textgreater} 50{\%} compared to headwater streams, and dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen increased by approximately 3-6 times. Decreasing dissolved P and increasing dissolved N raised stream-water N:P to 46 at the most downstream sites, suggesting a transition from N limitation in headwaters to potential P limitation in larger channels. We hypothesize that these changes were mediated by increasing algal photosynthesis and N fixation by benthic algal assemblages, which, in response to increasing light availability, strongly altered stream-water nutrient concentration and stoichiometry in larger streams and rivers.},

To date, designers have traditionally relied on environmental consultants to provide the best available science; however, serious gaps in our understanding of urban ecosystems remain. To evaluate ecosystem processes and services for sustainable urban design and to further advance our understanding of social-ecological processes within the urban context, we need to integrate primary research into the urban design process.

@article{Nadeau2007,
abstract = {In January 2001, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers exceeded its statutory authority by asserting Clean Water Act (CWA) jurisdiction over non-navigable, isolated, intrastate waters based solely on their use by migratory birds. The Supreme Courts majority opinion addressed broader issues of CWA jurisdiction by implying that the CWA intended some connection to navigability and that isola- ted waters need a significant nexus to navigable waters to be jurisdictional. Subsequent to this decision (SWANCC), there have been many lawsuits challenging CWA jurisdiction, many of which are focused on head- water, intermittent, and ephemeral streams. To inform the legal and policy debate surrounding this issue, we present information on the geographic distribution of headwater streams and intermittent and ephemeral streams throughout the U.S., summarize major findings from the scientific literature in considering hydrological connectivity between headwater streams and downstream waters, and relate the scientific information presented to policy issues surrounding the scope of waters protected under the CWA. Headwater streams comprise approximately 53{\%} (2,900,000 km) of the total stream length in the U.S., excluding Alaska, and intermittent and ephemeral streams comprise approximately 59{\%} (3,200,000 km) of the total stream length and approxi- mately 50{\%} (1,460,000 km) of the headwater stream length in the U.S., excluding Alaska. Hillslopes, headwater streams, and downstream waters are best described as individual elements of integrated hydrological systems. Hydrological connectivity allows for the exchange of mass, momentum, energy, and organisms longitudinally, laterally, vertically, and temporally between headwater streams and downstream waters. Via hydrological con- nectivity, headwater, intermittent and ephemeral streams cumulatively contribute to the functional integrity of downstream waters; hydrologically and ecologically, they are a part of the tributary system. As this debate con- tinues, scientific input from multiple fields will be important for policymaking at the federal, state, and local lev- els and to inform water resource management regardless of the level at which those decisions are being made. Strengthening the interface between science, policy, and public participation is critical if we are going to achieve effective water resource management.},

abstract = {A remote sensing based land cover change assessment methodology is presented and applied to a case study of the Oil Sands Mining Development in Athabasca, Alta., Canada. The primary impact was assessed using an information extraction method applied to two LANDSAT scenes. The analysis based on derived land cover maps shows a decrease of natural vegetation in the study area (715,094 ha) for 2001 approximately -8.64{\%} relative to 1992. Secondary assessment based on a key resources indicator (KRI), calculated using normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI measurements acquired by NOAA-AVHRR satellites), air temperature and global radiation was performed for a time period from 1990 to 2002. KRI trend analysis indicates a slightly decreasing trend in vegetation greenness in close proximity to the mining development. A good agreement between the time series of inter-annual variations in NDVI and air temperature is observed increasing the confidence of NDVI as an indicator for assessing vegetation productivity and its sensitivity to changes in local conditions.

abstract = {If a common set of landscape characteristics seem to predict spatial patterns of biodiversity in several regions with different biogeographic histories and com- munity compositions, these could inform conservation. Two papers recently published in Journal of Insect Con- servation provided evidence that topographic heterogeneity can play a major role in harbouring invertebrate commu- nity biodiversity, and that upland areas potentially function as refugia from infrequent but severe climatic conditions that occur over ecological timescales. Similar findings are being echoed in the growing body of phylogeographic lit- erature on terrestrial invertebrates from montane landscape settings. The purpose of this short communication is to place the two recently published papers into a broader context. Phylogeographic studies usually focus on genetic diversity within and among populations, and at relatively deep evolutionary timescales. The parallels that appear to be emerging across different levels of biological organi- sation and temporal spectra suggest that (1) microevolu- tionary processes operating at the level of populations may ‘scale-up' to macroevolutionary processes operating at the level of species or higher, and (2) certain landscape features—particularly topography—may be particularly important when formulating strategies to protect terrestrial invertebrate biodiversity.},

abstract = {We quantify the relationships between riverine nitrate–nitrogen (NN) concentration and agricultural land use in the continental United States – from the early 1900s through the end of the last century – on spatial scales ranging from the entire Mississippi River Basin to 1000-km2 watersheds. Cropland cover is linearly related to the NN concentration that exits a watershed at both the beginning and end of the 20th century. In addition, the slope of the relationship is higher at the end of the century, and the intercept of the regression analysis is not different from zero. These findings imply that agriculture was already affecting NN export by the early 1900s, that intensive management practices in modern agriculture have significantly increased the NN export per hectare of cropland, and that the baseline of exported NN has not shifted. We identify agricultural practices, principally associated with corn cultivation, that contribute substantially to NN concentrations and suggest that increasing cropland diversity and perennial plant cover can reduce NN loading.},

abstract = {Prevention of acid mine drainage at surface coal mines in the Appalachian region relies to an extent on minimizing ground water contact with acid-forming materials, and maximizing ground water contact with alkalinity-yielding materials. Acid-forming materials are often selectively handled to minimize or prevent contact with ground water. Controlling ground water contact with acidic or alkaline materials depends on forecasting the level and range of fluctuation of the postmining water table within the mine backfill. Physical measurements and aquifer testing of more than 120 wells from 18 reclaimed mines in Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia have led to improved forecasting of the postmining ground water system. Factors that influence the ground water regime include spoil lithology and particle size, age of reclamation, spoil thickness, distance from the final highwall, and pit floor dip angle and direction. Spoil hydraulic conductivity (K) exhibits a 95{\%} confidence interval range of six orders of magnitude about a mean K of 1.7 x 10(-5) m/sec. Spoil aquifer saturated thickness is related to the overall thickness of the spoil, the lithology of the spoil, dip of the pit floor, and distance to the highwall. Saturated spoil thickness has a 95{\%} confidence interval of 2.2 to 3.6 m about the mean of 2.9 m. The predicted saturated zone averages 19{\%} of the total spoil thickness.},

abstract = {The potential impacts of valley fills associated with mountaintop removal/valley fill (MTR/VF) coal mining on downstream flooding in the coalfields of eastern Kentucky and adjacent states are a subject of public debate and scientific uncertainty. This study explored two aspects of this issue. First, hydrologic indices of relative runoff production and surface and subsurface flow detention were applied to conditions typical of headwater and low-order drainage basins in eastern Kentucky. Results show that there is a clear risk of increased flooding (greater runoff production and less surface flow detention) following MTR/VF operations, and suggest that, on balance, valley fills are more likely to increase rather than decrease flood potential. However, there is a wide range of outcomes, qualitatively and quantitatively. Flood risks can be increased or decreased, and the degree of either may vary markedly. The effects of MTR/VF mining on downstream peak flows are highly contingent on local pre- and post-mining conditions, and it would be unwise to apply generalizations to specific sites. Second, the occurrence of flash floods downstream of MTR/VF operations when nearby unmined areas did not flood or had less severe floods has frequently been explained (without supporting data) in terms of locally greater precipitation. The likelihood of such short-range variability of storm precipitation is evaluated by applying the state probability function to NEXRAD radar estimates of precipitation for two 2001 storms which produced flash floods in eastern Kentucky. The spatial structure of the storm precipitation indicates that at the scale of the analysis (pixel size of approximately 2 km) large local variations in storm precipitation are unlikely-that is, the probability of nearby hollows or low-order drainage basins receiving substantially different storm precipitation totals is low.},

abstract = {The concepts, models and procedures used in Operational Research and Decision Aid (OR-DA), unlike their counterparts in the physical and natural sciences, can scarcely claim to describe realities which would be independent of the observer and which would exist independently of other human actors. We must admit that in most decision-making contexts, various participants in the process interact with reality — as much through the judgments they bring to bear as through their behavior — and contribute to creating what we would like to describe as an external object. Even in instances in which such interaction is virtually non-existant, the results or ‘truths' which the use of our concepts, models and procedures enables us to reach remain contingent upon numerous options (how a problem is formulated, the means by which uncertainty, imprecision and the ill-determination are taken into account, etc.), as well as upon one or more value systems. In order to give meaning to results produced in OR-DA, researchers have followed three main paths. Each of them may be, but does not necessarily have to be, associated with a particular quest: the path of realism and the quest for descriptions for discovering, the axiomatic path and the quest for norms for prescribing and the constructivist path and the quest for working hypotheses for recommending. Each of these paths and quests are presented in turn and submitted to a critical examination. It emerges therefrom that a ‘decision science' (the precise meaning of this expression is specified) can only be rooted in the path of realism, which implies accepting postulates and hypotheses which have proved unusable in the practice of OR-DA. The article concludes by showing how by shifting the object of the quest for knowledge it nonetheless appears possible to speak in terms of a decision-aid science. However, within this framework, the validity and viability of the body of knowledge produced remain sources of further questions.},

abstract = {Rock uplift and erosional denudation of orogenic belts have long been the most important geologic processes that serve to shape continental surfaces, but the rate of geomorphic change resulting from these natural phenomena has now been outstripped by human activities associated with agriculture, construction, and mining. Although humans are now the most important geomorphic agent on the planet's surface, natural and anthropogenic processes serve to modify quite different parts of Earth's landscape. In order to better understand the impact of humans on continental erosion, we have examined both long-term and short-term data on rates of sediment transfer in response to glacio-fluvial and anthropogenic processes.Phanerozoic rates of subaerial denudation inferred from preserved volumes of sedimentary rock require a mean continental erosion rate on the order of 16 m per million years (m/m.y.), resulting in the accumulation of ∼5 gigatons of sediment per year (Gt/yr). Erosion irregularly increased over the ∼542 m.y. span of Phanerozoic time to a Pliocene value of 53 m/m.y. (16 Gt/yr). Current estimates of large river sediment loads are similar to this late Neogene value, and require net denudation of ice-free land surfaces at a rate of ∼62 m/m.y. (∼21 Gt/yr). Consideration of the variation in large river sediment loads and the geomorphology of respective river basin catchments suggests that natural erosion is primarily confined to drainage headwaters; ∼83{\%} of the global river sediment flux is derived from the highest 10{\%} of Earth's surface.Subaerial erosion as a result of human activity, primarily through agricultural practices, has resulted in a sharp increase in net rates of continental denudation; although less well constrained than estimates based on surviving rock volumes or current river loads, available data suggest that present farmland denudation is proceeding at a rate of ∼600 m/m.y. (∼75 Gt/yr), and is largely confined to the lower elevations of Earth's land surface, primarily along passive continental margins; ∼83{\%} of cropland erosion occurs over the lower 65{\%} of Earth's surface.The conspicuous disparity between natural sediment fluxes suggested by data on rock volumes and river loads (∼21 Gt/yr) and anthropogenic fluxes inferred from measured and modeled cropland soil losses (75 Gt/yr) is readily resolved by data on thicknesses and ages of alluvial sediment that has been deposited immediately downslope from eroding croplands over the history of human agriculture. Accumulation of postsettlement alluvium on higher-order tributary channels and floodplains (mean rate ∼12,600 m/m.y.) is the most important geomorphic process in terms of the erosion and deposition of sediment that is currently shaping the landscape of Earth. It far exceeds even the impact of Pleistocene continental glaciers or the current impact of alpine erosion by glacial and/or fluvial processes. Conversely, available data suggest that since 1961, global cropland area has increased by ∼11{\%}, while the global population has approximately doubled. The net effect of both changes is that per capita cropland area has decreased by ∼44{\%} over this same time interval; ∼1{\%} per year. This is ∼25 times the rate of soil area loss anticipated from human denudation of cropland surfaces. In a context of per capita food production, soil loss through cropland erosion is largely insignificant when compared to the impact of population growth.},

The adjacent Savage River watershed (area 127.2 sq km) is unmined. Moments of flood frequency distributions indicated that climatic variability affected both watersheds similarly. Normalizing annual maximum flows by antecedent streamflow and causative precipitation helped identify trends in flooding response. Analysis of contemporary storm events using Next Generation Weather Radar (NEXRAD) stage III precipitation data showed that Georges Creek floods are characterized by higher peak runoff and a shorter centroid lag than Savage River floods, likely attributable to differences in current land use. Interestingly, Georges Creek produces only two thirds of the storm-flow volume as Savage River, apparently because of infiltration into abandoned deep mine workings and an associated transbasin diversion constructed circa 1900. Empirical trend analysis is thus complicated by both hydroclimatic variability and the legacy of deep mining in the basin.},

abstract = {Ecosystem management has been adopted as the philosophical paradigm guiding management on many federal forests in the United States. The strategic goal of ecosystem management is to find a sensible middle ground between ensuring long-term protection of the environment while allowing an increasing population to use its natural resources for maintaining and improving human life. Ecosystem management has all the characteristics of 'wicked' problems that are tricky, complex, and thorny. Ambiguities, conflicts, internal inconsistencies, unknown but large costs, lack of organized approaches, institutional shock and confusion, lack of scientific understanding of management consequences, and turbulent, rapidly changing power centers all contribute to the wickedness of the ecosystem management paradigm. Given that ecosystem management, Like human survival and welfare, is a wicked problem, how can we proceed to tame it? Managers need to use the same tools that people have always used for handling such problems - knowledge, organization, judicious simplification, and inspired leadership. The generic theory of decision support system development and application is well developed. Numerous specific ecosystem management decision support systems (EM-DSS) have been developed and are evolving in their capabilities. There is no doubt that given a set of ecosystem management processes to support and adequate time and resources, effective EM-DSS can be developed. On the other hand, there is considerable doubt that sufficiently detailed, explicitly described and widely accepted processes for implementing ecosystem management can be crafted given the current institutional, educational, social and political climate. A socio-political climate in which everyone wants to reap the benefits and no one wants to pay the costs, incapacitates the federal forest management decision making process. Developing a workable ecosystem management process and the decision making tools to support it is probably one of the most complex and urgent challenges facing us today. This paper offers a concise review of the state of the art of decision support systems related to implementing ecosystem management. A conceptual model of the context in which ecosystem management is expected to function is presented. Next, a candidate for an operational ecosystem management process is described and others are referenced. Finally, a generic ecosystem management decision support system is presented and many existing systems briefly described. (C) Published by Elsevier Science 1999.},

abstract = {More than half of all accessible freshwater has been appropriated for human use, and a substantial portion of terrestrial ecosystems have been transformed by human action. These impacts are heaviest in urban ecosystems, where impervious surfaces increase runoff, water delivery and stormflows are managed heavily, and there are substantial anthropogenic sources of nitrogen (N). Urbanization also frequently results in creation of intentional novel ecosystems. These "designed" ecosystems are fashioned to fulfill particular needs of the residents, or ecosystem services. In the Phoenix, Arizona area, the augmentation and redistribution of water has resulted in numerous component ecosystems that are atypical for a desert environment. Because these systems combine N loading with the presence of water, they may be hot spots of biogeochemical activity. The research presented here illustrates the types of hydrological modifications typical of desert cities and documents the extent and distribution of common designed aquatic ecosystems in the Phoenix metropolitan area: artificial lakes and stormwater retention basins. While both ecosystems were designed for other purposes (recreation/aesthetics and flood abatement, respectively), they have the potential to provide the added ecosystem service of N removal via denitrification. However, denitrification in urban lakes is likely to be limited by the rate of diffusion of nitrate into the sediment. Retention basins export some nitrate to groundwater, but grassy basins have higher denitrification rates than xeriscaped ones, due to higher soil moisture and organic matter content. An economic valuation of environmental amenities demonstrates the importance of abundant vegetation, proximity to water, and lower summer temperatures throughout the region. These amenities all may be provided by designed, water-intensive ecosystems. Some ecosystems are specifically designed for multiple uses, but maximizing one ecosystem service often entails trade-offs with other services. Further investigation into the distribution, bundling, and tradeoffs among water-related ecosystem services shows that some types of services are constrained by the hydrogeomorphology of the area, while for others human engineering and the creation of designed ecosystems has enabled the delivery of hydrologic ecosystem services independent of natural constraints.},

This article reviews the origins of the QWERTY keyboard, and other sequential keyboards which have been developed since 1909. The reasoning behind the design of these other keyboards and the subsequent impact they made on the keyboard world are discussed. Various explanations are suggested as to why this previous research has not had any effect on the design of the QWERTY keyboard.},

@article{Ng2014,
abstract = {Time is of the essence in conservation biology. To secure the persistence of a species, we need to understand how to balance time spent among different management actions. A new and simple method to test the efficacy of a range of conservation actions is required. Thus, we devised a general theoretical framework to help determine whether to test a new action and when to cease a trial and revert to an existing action if the new action did not perform well. The framework involves constructing a general population model under the different management actions and specifying a management objective. By maximizing the management objective, we could generate an analytical solution that identifies the optimal timing of when to change management action. We applied the analytical solution to the case of the Christmas Island pipistrelle bat (Pipistrelle murrayi), a species for which captive breeding might have prevented its extinction. For this case, we used our model to determine whether to start a captive breeding program and when to stop a captive breeding program and revert to managing the species in the wild, given that the management goal is to maximize the chance of reaching a target wild population size. For the pipistrelle bat, captive breeding was to start immediately and it was desirable to place the species in captivity for the entire management period. The optimal time to revert to managing the species in the wild was driven by several key parameters, including the management goal, management time frame, and the growth rates of the population under different management actions. Knowing when to change management actions can help conservation managers' act in a timely fashion to avoid species extinction.},

@article{Bowman2011,
abstract = {Humans and their ancestors are unique in being a fire-making species, but 'natural' (i.e. independent of humans) fires have an ancient, geological history on Earth. Natural fires have influenced biological evolution and global biogeochemical cycles, making fire integral to the functioning of some biomes. Globally, debate rages about the impact on ecosystems of prehistoric human-set fires, with views ranging from catastrophic to negligible. Understanding of the diversity of human fire regimes on Earth in the past, present and future remains rudimentary. It remains uncertain how humans have caused a departure from 'natural' background levels that vary with climate change. Available evidence shows that modern humans can increase or decrease background levels of natural fire activity by clearing forests, promoting grazing, dispersing plants, altering ignition patterns and actively suppressing fires, thereby causing substantial ecosystem changes and loss of biodiversity. Some of these contemporary fire regimes cause substantial economic disruptions owing to the destruction of infrastructure, degradation of ecosystem services, loss of life, and smoke-related health effects. These episodic disasters help frame negative public attitudes towards landscape fires, despite the need for burning to sustain some ecosystems. Greenhouse gas-induced warming and changes in the hydrological cycle may increase the occurrence of large, severe fires, with potentially significant feedbacks to the Earth system. Improved understanding of human fire regimes demands: (1) better data on past and current human influences on fire regimes to enable global comparative analyses, (2) a greater understanding of different cultural traditions of landscape burning and their positive and negative social, economic and ecological effects, and (3) more realistic representations of anthropogenic fire in global vegetation and climate change models. We provide an historical framework to promote understanding of the development and diversification of fire regimes, covering the pre-human period, human domestication of fire, and the subsequent transition from subsistence agriculture to industrial economies. All of these phases still occur on Earth, providing opportunities for comparative research.},

abstract = {Localized ecological interactions can generate striking large-scale spatial patterns in ecosystems through spatial self-organization. Possible mechanisms include oscillating consumer-resource interactions, localized disturbance-recovery processes and scale-dependent feedback. Despite abundant theoretical literature, studies revealing spatial self-organization in real ecosystems are limited. Recently, however, many examples of regular pattern formation have been discovered, supporting the importance of scale-dependent feedback. Here, we review these studies, showing regular pattern formation to be a general phenomenon rather than a peculiarity. We provide a conceptual framework explaining how scale-dependent feedback determines regular pattern formation in ecosystems. More empirical studies are needed to better understand regular pattern formation in ecosystems, and how this affects the response of ecosystems to global environmental change.},

abstract = {It has been suggested that tropical forest and savanna could represent alternative stable states, implying critical transitions at tipping points in response to altered climate or other drivers. So far, evidence for this idea has remained elusive, and integrated climate models assume smooth vegetation responses. We analyzed data on the distribution of tree cover in Africa, Australia, and South America to reveal strong evidence for the existence of three distinct attractors: forest, savanna, and a treeless state. Empirical reconstruction of the basins of attraction indicates that the resilience of the states varies in a universal way with precipitation. These results allow the identification of regions where forest or savanna may most easily tip into an alternative state, and they pave the way to a new generation of coupled climate models.},

abstract = {The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) introduced a new framework for analyzing social-ecological systems that has had wide influence in the policy and scientific communities. Studies after the MA are taking up new challenges in the basic science needed to assess, project, and manage flows of ecosystem services and effects on human well-being. Yet, our ability to draw general conclusions remains limited by focus on discipline-bound sectors of the full social-ecological system. At the same time, some polices and practices intended to improve ecosystem services and human well-being are based on untested assumptions and sparse information. The people who are affected and those who provide resources are increasingly asking for evidence that interventions improve ecosystem services and human well-being. New research is needed that considers the full ensemble of processes and feedbacks, for a range of biophysical and social systems, to better understand and manage the dynamics of the relationship between humans and the ecosystems on which they rely. Such research will expand the capacity to address fundamental questions about complex social-ecological systems while evaluating assumptions of policies and practices intended to advance human well-being through improved ecosystem services.},

@article{Lion2011,
abstract = {Much of the literature on social evolution is pervaded by the old debate about the relative merits of kin and group selection. In this debate, the biological interpretation of processes occurring in real populations is often conflated with the mathematical methodology used to describe these processes. Here, we highlight the distinction between the two by placing this discussion within the broader context of evolution in structured populations. In this review we show that the current debate overlooks important aspects of the interplay between genetic and demographic structuring, and argue that a continued focus on the relative merits of kin versus group selection distracts attention from moving the field forward.},

Whether adaptation is promoted or slowed by population subdivision, with or without turnover, remains a subject of theoretical debate.},

@article{Jaeger2014,
abstract = {Protecting hydrologic connectivity of freshwater ecosystems is fundamental to ensuring species persistence, ecosystem integrity, and human well-being. More frequent and severe droughts associated with climate change are poised to significantly alter flow intermittence patterns and hydrologic connectivity in dryland streams of the American Southwest, with deleterious effects on highly endangered fishes. By integrating local-scale hydrologic modeling with emerging approaches in landscape ecology, we quantify fine-resolution, watershed-scale changes in habitat size, spacing, and connectance under forecasted climate change in the Verde River Basin, United States. Model simulations project annual zero-flow day frequency to increase by 27{\%} by midcentury, with differential seasonal consequences on continuity (temporal continuity at discrete locations) and connectivity (spatial continuity within the network). A 17{\%} increase in the frequency of stream drying events is expected throughout the network with associated increases in the duration of these events. Flowing portions of the river network will diminish between 8{\%} and 20{\%} in spring and early summer and become increasingly isolated by more frequent and longer stretches of dry channel fragments, thus limiting the opportunity for native fishes to access spawning habitats and seasonally available refuges. Model predictions suggest that midcentury and late century climate will reduce network-wide hydrologic connectivity for native fishes by 6-9{\%} over the course of a year and up to 12-18{\%} during spring spawning months. Our work quantifies climate-induced shifts in stream drying and connectivity across a large river network and demonstrates their implications for the persistence of a globally endemic fish fauna.},

abstract = {Natural chemical weathering of silicate rocks is a significant sink for soil and atmospheric CO(2). Previous work suggested that natural chemical weathering may be stimulated by applying finely ground silicate rocks to agricultural areas or forests [stimulated weathering (SW)]. However, it remained unknown if this technique is practical to sequester globally significant amounts of CO(2) under realistic conditions. Applying first estimates of "normal treatment" amounts from a literature review, we report here a theoretical global maximum potential of 65 10(6) t sequestered C a(-1) if SW would be applied homogenously on all agricultural and forested areas of the world. This is equivalent to 0.9{\%} of anthropogenic CO(2) emissions (reference period 2000-2005). First, however, the assumed application of SW on most of the considered areas is not economically feasible because of logistic issues, and second the net-CO(2) sequestration is expected to amount to only a fraction of consumed CO(2) due to the energy demand of the application itself (currently {\~{}}11{\%}). Unless progress in application procedures is provided, the recent realistic maximum net-CO(2)-consumption potential is expected to be much smaller than 0.1{\%} of anthropogenic emissions, and the SW would thus not be one of the key techniques to reduce atmospheric CO(2) concentration. However, literature suggests that for some agricultural areas (croplands) and specifically for rice production areas in humid climates, this SW may be a feasible tool to support international efforts to sequester CO(2). SW may be cost effective for those areas if linked to the CO(2)-emission certificate trade in the future, and increases in crop production are taken into account.},

@article{Syvitski2011,
abstract = {Data and computer simulations are reviewed to help better define the timing and magnitude of human influence on sediment flux--the Anthropocene epoch. Impacts on the Earth surface processes are not spatially or temporally homogeneous. Human influences on this sediment flux have a secondary effect on floodplain and delta-plain functions and sediment dispersal into the coastal ocean. Human impact on sediment production began 3000 years ago but accelerated more widely 1000 years ago. By the sixteenth century, societies were already engineering their environment. Early twentieth century mechanization has led to global signals of increased sediment flux in most large rivers. By the 1950s, this sediment disturbance signal reversed for many rivers owing to the proliferation of dams, and sediment load reduction below pristine conditions is the dominant signal today. A delta subsidence signal began in the 1930s and is now a dominant signal in terms of sea level for many coastal environments, overwhelming even the global warming imprint on sea level. Humans have engineered how most water and sediment are discharged into the coastal ocean. Hyperpycnal flow events have become more common for some rivers, and less common for other rivers. Bottom trawling is now widespread, suggesting that even continental shelves have received a significant but as yet quantified Anthropocene impact. The Anthropocene attains the level of a geological climate event, such as that seen in the transition between the Pleistocene and the Holocene.},

abstract = {Otolith elemental (Sr:Ca, Ba:Ca, Mn:Ca, Mg:Ca and Rb:Ca) and isotopic (⁸⁷Sr:⁸⁶Sr) profiles from several annual cohorts of juvenile Atlantic salmon Salmo salar were related to the physico-chemical characteristics (chemical signatures, flow rate, temperature and conductivity) of their natal rivers over an annual hydrological cycle. Only Sr:Ca, Ba:Ca and ⁸⁷Sr:⁸⁶Sr in otoliths were determined by their respective ratios in the ambient water. Sr:Ca ratios in stream waters fluctuated strongly on a seasonal basis, but these fluctuations, mainly driven by water flow regimes, were not recorded in the otoliths. Otolith Sr:Ca ratios remained constant during freshwater residency at a given site and were exclusively related to water Sr:Ca ratios during low flow periods. While interannual differences in otolith elemental composition among rivers were observed, this variability was minor compared to geographic variability and did not limit classification of juveniles to their natal stream. Success in discriminating fish from different sites was greatest using Sr isotopes as it remained relatively constant across years at a given location.},

In this study we investigated mining in the Coal River Watershed, West Virginia, USA, using landform terrain analysis. Previous studies have relied on elevation differencing of pre- and post-mining surfaces to assess absolute elevation and volumetric change. Our landscape analysis, utilizing light detection and ranging (LiDAR)-derived elevation data, indicated specific landform types and distributions that were significantly altered after MTR/VF mining and reclamation. The use of categorical landform data provides insights to assessing and understanding the extent of topographically altered mountaintops. Our study provides an opportunity to further examine the impact of MTR/VF on forest communities, terrestrial habitat, ecosystem health, and biodiversity.},

@article{Santoro2011c,
abstract = {The ocean is an important global source of nitrous oxide (N(2)O), a greenhouse gas that contributes to stratospheric ozone destruction. Bacterial nitrification and denitrification are thought to be the primary sources of marine N(2)O, but the isotopic signatures of N(2)O produced by these processes are not consistent with the marine contribution to the global N(2)O budget. Based on enrichment cultures, we report that archaeal ammonia oxidation also produces N(2)O. Natural-abundance stable isotope measurements indicate that the produced N(2)O had bulk $\delta$(15)N and $\delta$(18)O values higher than observed for ammonia-oxidizing bacteria but similar to the $\delta$(15)N and $\delta$(18)O values attributed to the oceanic N(2)O source to the atmosphere. Our results suggest that ammonia-oxidizing archaea may be largely responsible for the oceanic N(2)O source.},

abstract = {Adaptive management is an approach to managing natural resources that emphasizes learning from the implementation of policies and strategies. Adaptive management appears to offer a solution to the management gridlock caused by increasing complexity and uncertainty. The concept of adaptive management has been embraced by natural resource managers worldwide, but there are relatively few published examples of adaptive management in use. In this article, we explore two watershed management projects in southeastern Australia to better understand the potential of adaptive management in regional scale programs through qualitative, case study-based investigation. The program logic of one case implies the use of passive adaptive management, whereas the second case claims to be based on active adaptive management. Data were created using participant observation, semistructured interviews with individuals and groups, and document review. Using thematic content and metaphor analysis to explore the case data, we found that each case was successful as an implementation project. However, the use of both passive and active adaptive management was constrained by deeply entrenched social norms and institutional frameworks. We identified seven "imperatives" that guided the behavior of project stakeholders, and that have consequences for the use of adaptive management. Reference to recent evaluations of the Adaptive Management Areas of the Pacific Northwest of the United States suggests that some of these imperatives and their consequences have broad applicability. The implications of our findings are discussed, and suggestions for improving the outcomes of regional scale adaptive management are provided.},

abstract = {The challenges that face humanity today differ from the past because as the scale of human influence has increased, our biggest challenges have become global in nature, and formerly local problems that could be addressed by shifting populations or switching resources, now aggregate (i.e., "scale up") limiting potential management options. Adaptive management is an approach to natural resource management that emphasizes learning through management based on the philosophy that knowledge is incomplete and much of what we think we know is actually wrong. Adaptive management has explicit structure, including careful elucidation of goals, identification of alternative management objectives and hypotheses of causation, and procedures for the collection of data followed by evaluation and reiteration. It is evident that adaptive management has matured, but it has also reached a crossroads. Practitioners and scientists have developed adaptive management and structured decision making techniques, and mathematicians have developed methods to reduce the uncertainties encountered in resource management, yet there continues to be misapplication of the method and misunderstanding of its purpose. Ironically, the confusion over the term "adaptive management" may stem from the flexibility inherent in the approach, which has resulted in multiple interpretations of "adaptive management" that fall along a continuum of complexity and a priori design. Adaptive management is not a panacea for the navigation of 'wicked problems' as it does not produce easy answers, and is only appropriate in a subset of natural resource management problems where both uncertainty and controllability are high. Nonetheless, the conceptual underpinnings of adaptive management are simple; there will always be inherent uncertainty and unpredictability in the dynamics and behavior of complex social-ecological systems, but management decisions must still be made, and whenever possible, we should incorporate learning into management.},

Producing accessible and unbiased visualisations from complicated, uncertain data requires expertise and knowledge from science, policy, computing, and design. However, visualisation is rarely found in our scientific training, organisations, or collaborations. As new policy programmes develop [e.g., the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES)], we need information visualisation to permeate increasingly both the work of scientists and science policy. The alternative is increased potential for missed discoveries, miscommunications, and, at worst, creating a bias towards the research that is easiest to display.},

@article{Vengosh2013,
abstract = {Mountaintop mining (MTM) is the primary procedure for surface coal exploration within the central Appalachian region of the eastern United States, and it is known to contaminate streams in local watersheds. In this study, we measured the chemical and isotopic compositions of water samples from MTM-impacted tributaries and streams in the Mud River watershed in West Virginia. We systematically document the isotopic compositions of three major constituents: sulfur isotopes in sulfate ($\delta$(34)SSO4), carbon isotopes in dissolved inorganic carbon ($\delta$(13)CDIC), and strontium isotopes ((87)Sr/(86)Sr). The data show that $\delta$(34)SSO4, $\delta$(13)CDIC, Sr/Ca, and (87)Sr/(86)Sr measured in saline- and selenium-rich MTM impacted tributaries are distinguishable from those of the surface water upstream of mining impacts. These tracers can therefore be used to delineate and quantify the impact of MTM in watersheds. High Sr/Ca and low (87)Sr/(86)Sr characterize tributaries that originated from active MTM areas, while tributaries from reclaimed MTM areas had low Sr/Ca and high (87)Sr/(86)Sr. Leaching experiments of rocks from the watershed show that pyrite oxidation and carbonate dissolution control the solute chemistry with distinct (87)Sr/(86)Sr ratios characterizing different rock sources. We propose that MTM operations that access the deeper Kanawha Formation generate residual mined rocks in valley fills from which effluents with distinctive (87)Sr/(86)Sr and Sr/Ca imprints affect the quality of the Appalachian watersheds.},

Water movement through the general mine spoil is relatively slow, reflecting the base topography and lack of power in the plateau region.


Valley fills, which still have some topography have rapid water movement, despite equal K rates. 


TDS values are really high in mine spoil, but much lower coming from valley fills.

There are likely lots of areas within the spoil that are low permeability whcih could promote rapid horizontal movement of groundwater. 


Low elevation throughout non-valley fill spoil could hold water for long periods of time. Once water reaches the buried valleys it is rapidly routed through them.},

abstract = {Regulatory agencies need methods to quantify the influence of headwater streams on downstream water quality as a result of litigation surrounding jurisdictional criteria and the influence of mountaintop removal coal mining activities. We collected comprehensive, spatially referenced physicochemical data (pH, dissolved oxygen, temperature, and specific conductance) from the partially mined Buckhorn Creek, KY, watershed in summer 2005 (n = 239 sites) and spring 2006 (n = 494 sites). We found conductivity was {\textgreater}10X higher in mined streams than in forested streams. Semivariograms, which quantify the degree of spatial dependence in chemistry values, indicated summer temperatures in both mined and unmined portions of the watershed had similar lag distances (approximately 5 km). Data for other parameters and seasons, however, violated model assumptions because of strong confluence effects in headwaters. We therefore developed a post hoc predictive model for water physicochemistry downstream of confluences using watershed areas as weighting factors. This weighted average model accurately predicted downstream conductivity (mean absolute error, MAE = 55.34 {\&}{\#}956;S cm{\&}{\#}8722;1), pH (MAE = 0.16 units), and temperature (MAE = 0.41°C) for confluences in Buckhorn Creek and two additional watersheds with headwater disturbance in West Virginia and Ohio. Use of semivariograms or predictive confluence models can help regulatory agents identify downstream influence of headwater streams and presence of a {\&}{\#}8220;significant nexus{\&}{\#}8221; with downstream waters.},

abstract = {Agricultural ecosystems provide humans with food, forage, bioenergy and pharmaceuticals and are essential to human wellbeing. These systems rely on ecosystem services provided by natural ecosystems, including pollination, biological pest control, maintenance of soil structure and fertility, nutrient cycling and hydrological services. Preliminary assessments indicate that the value of these ecosystem services to agriculture is enormous and often underappreciated. Agroecosystems also produce a variety of ecosystem services, such as regulation of soil and water quality, carbon sequestration, support for biodiversity and cultural services. Depending on management practices, agriculture can also be the source of numerous disservices, including loss of wildlife habitat, nutrient runoff, sedimentation of waterways, greenhouse gas emissions, and pesticide poisoning of humans and non-target species. The tradeoffs that may occur between provisioning services and other ecosystem services and disservices should be evaluated in terms of spatial scale, temporal scale and reversibility. As more effective methods for valuing ecosystem services become available, the potential for 'win-win' scenarios increases. Under all scenarios, appropriate agricultural management practices are critical to realizing the benefits of ecosystem services and reducing disservices from agricultural activities.},

@misc{Wolman1960,
abstract = {The relative importance in geomorphic processes of extreme or catastrophic events and more frequent events of smaller magnitude can be measured in terms of (1) the relative amounts of "work" done on the landscape and (2) in terms of the formation of specific features of the landscape. For many processes, above the level of competence, the rate of movement of material can be expressed as a power function of some stress, as for example, shear stress. Because the frequency distributions of the magnitudes of many natural events, such as floods, rainfall, and wind speeds, approximate log-normal distributions, the product of frequency and rate, a measure of the work performed by events having different frequencies and magnitudes will attain a maximum. The frequency at which this maximum occurs provides a measure of the level at which the largest portion of the total work is accomplished. Analysis of records of sediment transported by rivers indicates that the largest portion of the total load is carried by flows which occur on the average once or twice each year. As the variability of the flow increases and hence as the size of the drainage basin decreases, a larger percentage of the total load is carried by less frequent flows. In many basins 90 per cent of the sediment is removed by storm discharges which recur at least once every five years. Transport of sand and dust by wind in general follows the same laws. The extreme velocities associated with infrequent events are compensated for by their rarity, and it is found that the greatest bulk of sediment is transported by more moderate events. Many rivers are competent to erode both bed and banks during moderate flows. Observations of natural channels suggest that the channel shape as well as the dimensions of meandering rivers appear to be associated with flows at or near the bankfull stage. The fact that the bankfull stage recurs on the average once every year or two years indicates that these features of many alluvial rivers are controlled by these more frequent flows rather than by the rarer events of catastrophic magnitude. Because the equilibrium form of wind-blown dunes and of wave-formed beaches is quite unstable, the frequency of the events responsible for their form is less clearly definable. However, dune form and orientation are determined by both wind velocity and frequency. Similarly, a hypothetical example suggests that beach slope oscillates about a mean value related in part to wave characteristics generated by winds of moderate speed. Where stresses generated by frequent events are incompetent to transport available materials, less frequent ones of greater magnitude are obviously required. Closer observation of many geomorphic processes is required before the relative importance of different processes and of events of differing magnitude and frequency in the formation of given features of the landscape can be adequately evaluated.

Today, approximately a billion people are chronically malnourished while our agricultural systems are concurrently degrading land, water, biodiversity and climate on a global scale. To meet the world's future food security and sustainability needs, food production must grow substantially while, at the same time, agriculture's environmental footprint must shrink dramatically. Here we analyse solutions to this dilemma, showing that tremendous progress could be made by halting agricultural expansion, closing 'yield gaps' on underperforming lands, increasing cropping efficiency, shifting diets and reducing waste. Together, these strategies could double food production while greatly reducing the environmental impacts of agriculture.},

abstract = {While several thousand square kilometers of land area have been subject to surface mining in the Central Appalachians, no reliable estimate exists for how much coal is produced per unit landscape disturbance. We provide this estimate using regional satellite-derived mine delineations and historical county-level coal production data for the period 1985-2005, and further relate the aerial extent of mining disturbance to stream impairment and loss of ecosystem carbon sequestration potential. To meet current US coal demands, an area the size of Washington DC would need to be mined every 81 days. A one-year supply of coal would result in ∼2,300 km of stream impairment and a loss of ecosystem carbon sequestration capacity comparable to the global warming potential of {\textgreater}33,000 US homes. For the first time, the environmental impacts of surface coal mining can be directly scaled with coal production rates.},

@article{Skousen2002,
abstract = {Acid-base accounting (ABA) is an analytical procedure that provides values to help assess the acid-producing and acid-neutralizing potential of overburden rocks prior to coal mining and other large-scale excavations. This procedure was developed by West Virginia University scientists during the 1960s. After the passage of laws requiring an assessment of surface mining on water quality, ABA became a preferred method to predict post-mining water quality, and permitting decisions for surface mines are largely based on the values determined by ABA. To predict the post-mining water quality, the amount of acid-producing rock is compared with the amount of acid-neutralizing rock, and a prediction of the water quality at the site (whether acid or alkaline) is obtained. We gathered geologic and geographic data for 56 mined sites in West Virginia, which allowed us to estimate total overburden amounts, and values were determined for maximum potential acidity (MPA), neutralization potential (NP), net neutralization potential (NNP), and NP to MPA ratios for each site based on ABA. These values were correlated to post-mining water quality from springs or seeps on the mined property. Overburden mass was determined by three methods, with the method used by Pennsylvania researchers showing the most accurate results for overburden mass. A poor relationship existed between MPA and post-mining water quality, NP was intermediate, and NNP and the NP to MPA ratio showed the best prediction accuracy. In this study, NNP and the NP to MPA ratio gave identical water quality prediction results. Therefore, with NP to MPA ratios, values were separated into categories: {\textless}1 should produce acid drainage, between 1 and 2 can produce either acid or alkaline water conditions, and {\textgreater}2 should produce alkaline water. On our 56 surface mined sites, NP to MPA ratios varied from 0.1 to 31, and six sites (11{\%}) did not fit the expected pattern using this category approach. Two sites with ratios {\textless}1 did not produce acid drainage as predicted (the drainage was neutral), and four sites with a ratio {\textgreater}2 produced acid drainage when they should not have. These latter four sites were either mined very slowly, had nonrepresentative ABA data, received water from an adjacent underground mine, or had a surface mining practice that degraded the water. In general, an NP to MPA ratio of {\textless}1 produced mostly acid drainage sites, between 1 and 2 produced mostly alkaline drainage sites, while NP to MPA ratios {\textgreater}2 produced alkaline drainage with a few exceptions. Using these values, ABA is a good tool to assess overburden quality before surface mining and to predict post-mining drainage quality after mining. The interpretation from ABA values was correct in 50 out of 52 cases (96{\%}), excluding the four anomalous sites, which had acid water for reasons other than overburden quality.},

abstract = {Acid mine drainage (AMD) causes environmental pollution that affects many countries having historic or current mining industries. Preventing the formation or the migration of AMD from its source is generally considered to be the preferable option, although this is not feasible in many locations, and in such cases, it is necessary to collect, treat, and discharge mine water. There are various options available for remediating AMD, which may be divided into those that use either chemical or biological mechanisms to neutralise AMD and remove metals from solution. Both abiotic and biological systems include those that are classed as "active" (i.e., require continuous inputs of resources to sustain the process) or "passive" (i.e., require relatively little resource input once in operation). This review describes the current abiotic and bioremediative strategies that are currently used to mitigate AMD and compares the strengths and weaknesses of each. New and emerging technologies are also described. In addition, the factors that currently influence the selection of a remediation system, and how these criteria may change in the future, are discussed.},

abstract = {Wavelet transform and multiresolution decomposition are described. Examples of the application of orthogonal wavelet transform to acoustic evoked potentials and otoacoustic emissions (OEA) are given and basic features of wavelet packets and wavelet network methods are characterized. An approach that enables the identification of local signal structures--a generalization of wavelet transform called Matching Pursuit--is presented. In the framework of this method the signal is decomposed into time-frequency 'atoms', which offers a possibility of determination of an 'instantaneous frequency' with the accuracy close to the theoretical limit. The method is illustrated by application to OAE signals. The advantages and limitations of the methods presented are discussed.},

abstract = {We determined the biogeographical distributions of stream bacteria and the biogeochemical factors that best explained heterogeneity for 23 locations within the Hubbard Brook watershed, a 3000-ha forested watershed in New Hampshire, USA. Our goal was to assess the factor, or set of factors, responsible for generating the biogeographical patterns exhibited by microorganisms at the landscape scale. We used DNA fingerprinting to characterize bacteria inhabiting fine benthic organic matter (FBOM) because of their important influence on stream nutrient dynamics. Across the watershed, streams of similar pH had similar FBOM bacterial communities. Streamwater pH was the single variable most strongly correlated with the relative distance between communities (Spearman's p = 0.66, P {\textless} 0.001) although there were other contributing factors, including the quality of the fine benthic organic matter and the amount of dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen in the stream water (P {\textless} 0.05 for each). There was no evidence of an effect of geographic distance on bacterial community composition, suggesting that dispersal limitation has little influence on the observed biogeographical patterns in streams across this landscape. Cloning and sequencing of small-subunit rRNA genes confirmed the DNA fingerprinting results and revealed strong shifts among bacterial groups along the pH gradient. With an increase in streamwater pH, the abundance of acidobacteria in the FBOM bacterial community decreased (from 71{\%} to 38{\%}), and the abundance of proteobacteria increased (from 11{\%} to 47{\%}). Together these results suggest that microorganisms, like "macro"-organisms, do exhibit biogeographical patterns at the landscape scale and that these patterns may be predictable based on biogeochemical factors.},

abstract = {Denitrifying prokaryotes use NO(x) as terminal electron acceptors in response to oxygen depletion. The process emits a mixture of NO, N(2)O and N(2), depending on the relative activity of the enzymes catalysing the stepwise reduction of NO(3)(-) to N(2)O and finally to N(2). Cultured denitrifying prokaryotes show characteristic transient accumulation of NO(2)(-), NO and N(2)O during transition from oxic to anoxic respiration, when tested under standardized conditions, but this character appears unrelated to phylogeny. Thus, although the denitrifying community of soils may differ in their propensity to emit N(2)O, it may be difficult to predict such characteristics by analysis of the community composition. A common feature of strains tested in our laboratory is that the relative amounts of N(2)O produced (N(2)O/(N(2)+N(2)O) product ratio) is correlated with acidity, apparently owing to interference with the assembly of the enzyme N(2)O reductase. The same phenomenon was demonstrated for soils and microbial communities extracted from soils. Liming could be a way to reduce N(2)O emissions, but needs verification by field experiments. More sophisticated ways to reduce emissions may emerge in the future as we learn more about the regulation of denitrification at the cellular level.},

abstract = {We investigated the abundance, community composition and transcriptional activity of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB) in the acidic fen Schl{\"{o}}ppnerbrunnen (Germany) that was subjected to water table manipulations. Quantitative PCR targeting amoA gene copies and transcripts showed that AOA dominated the ammonia-oxidizing community in the upper 20 cm of the peat soil. Numbers of archaeal amoA gene copies and transcripts as well as the relative fraction of AOA of the total archaea decreased with depth. AOA-AmoA sequences were 96.2-98.9{\%} identical to that of Candidatus Nitrosotalea devanaterra while bacterial AmoA sequences affiliated with Nitrosospira clusters 2 and 4. Archaeal but not bacterial amoA transcripts were detected in short-term laboratory incubations of peat that showed nitrifying activity. Nitrate accumulated in the peat pore water after 6 weeks of induced drought during a field experiment. Subsequent rewetting resulted in a significant decrease of AOA transcriptional activity, indicating that AOA responded to water table fluctuations on the transcriptional level. Our results suggest that nitrification in this fen is primarily linked to archaeal ammonia oxidation. pH and anoxia appear to be key factors regulating AOA community composition, vertical distribution and activity in acidic fens.},

abstract = {In the coming decades, a crucial challenge for humanity will be meeting future food demands without undermining further the integrity of the Earth's environmental systems. Agricultural systems are already major forces of global environmental degradation, but population growth and increasing consumption of calorie- and meat-intensive diets are expected to roughly double human food demand by 2050 (ref. 3). Responding to these pressures, there is increasing focus on 'sustainable intensification' as a means to increase yields on underperforming landscapes while simultaneously decreasing the environmental impacts of agricultural systems. However, it is unclear what such efforts might entail for the future of global agricultural landscapes. Here we present a global-scale assessment of intensification prospects from closing 'yield gaps' (differences between observed yields and those attainable in a given region), the spatial patterns of agricultural management practices and yield limitation, and the management changes that may be necessary to achieve increased yields. We find that global yield variability is heavily controlled by fertilizer use, irrigation and climate. Large production increases (45{\%} to 70{\%} for most crops) are possible from closing yield gaps to 100{\%} of attainable yields, and the changes to management practices that are needed to close yield gaps vary considerably by region and current intensity. Furthermore, we find that there are large opportunities to reduce the environmental impact of agriculture by eliminating nutrient overuse, while still allowing an approximately 30{\%} increase in production of major cereals (maize, wheat and rice). Meeting the food security and sustainability challenges of the coming decades is possible, but will require considerable changes in nutrient and water management.},

abstract = {One of the greatest sources of uncertainty for future climate predictions is the response of the global carbon cycle to climate change. Although approximately one-half of total CO(2) emissions is at present taken up by combined land and ocean carbon reservoirs, models predict a decline in future carbon uptake by these reservoirs, resulting in a positive carbon-climate feedback. Several recent studies suggest that rates of carbon uptake by the land and ocean have remained constant or declined in recent decades. Other work, however, has called into question the reported decline. Here we use global-scale atmospheric CO(2) measurements, CO(2) emission inventories and their full range of uncertainties to calculate changes in global CO(2) sources and sinks during the past 50 years. Our mass balance analysis shows that net global carbon uptake has increased significantly by about 0.05 billion tonnes of carbon per year and that global carbon uptake doubled, from 2.4 ± 0.8 to 5.0 ± 0.9 billion tonnes per year, between 1960 and 2010. Therefore, it is very unlikely that both land and ocean carbon sinks have decreased on a global scale. Since 1959, approximately 350 billion tonnes of carbon have been emitted by humans to the atmosphere, of which about 55 per cent has moved into the land and oceans. Thus, identifying the mechanisms and locations responsible for increasing global carbon uptake remains a critical challenge in constraining the modern global carbon budget and predicting future carbon-climate interactions.},

abstract = {Whether through sea level rise or wetland restoration, agricultural soils in coastal areas will be inundated at increasing rates, renewing connections to sensitive surface waters and raising critical questions about environmental trade-offs. Wetland restoration is often implemented in agricultural catchments to improve water quality through nutrient removal. Yet flooding of soils can also increase production of the greenhouse gases nitrous oxide and methane, representing a potential environmental trade-off. Our study aimed to quantify and compare greenhouse gas emissions from unmanaged and restored forested wetlands, as well as actively managed agricultural fields within the North Carolina coastal plain, USA. In sampling conducted once every two months over a two-year comparative study, we found that soil carbon dioxide flux (range: 8000-64 800 kg CO2 x ha(-1) x yr(-1)) comprised 66-100{\%} of total greenhouse gas emissions from all sites and that methane emissions (range: -6.87 to 197 kg CH4 x ha(-1) x yr(-1)) were highest from permanently inundated sites, while nitrous oxide fluxes (range: -1.07 to 139 kg N2O x ha(-1) x yr(-1)) were highest in sites with lower water tables. Contrary to predictions, greenhouse gas fluxes (as CO2 equivalents) from the restored wetland were lower than from either agricultural fields or unmanaged forested wetlands. In these acidic coastal freshwater ecosystems, the conversion of agricultural fields to flooded young forested wetlands did not result in increases in greenhouse gas emissions.},

abstract = {Large uncertainties in the budget of atmospheric methane, an important greenhouse gas, limit the accuracy of climate change projections. Thaw lakes in North Siberia are known to emit methane, but the magnitude of these emissions remains uncertain because most methane is released through ebullition (bubbling), which is spatially and temporally variable. Here we report a new method of measuring ebullition and use it to quantify methane emissions from two thaw lakes in North Siberia. We show that ebullition accounts for 95 per cent of methane emissions from these lakes, and that methane flux from thaw lakes in our study region may be five times higher than previously estimated. Extrapolation of these fluxes indicates that thaw lakes in North Siberia emit 3.8 teragrams of methane per year, which increases present estimates of methane emissions from northern wetlands ({\textless} 6-40 teragrams per year; refs 1, 2, 4-6) by between 10 and 63 per cent. We find that thawing permafrost along lake margins accounts for most of the methane released from the lakes, and estimate that an expansion of thaw lakes between 1974 and 2000, which was concurrent with regional warming, increased methane emissions in our study region by 58 per cent. Furthermore, the Pleistocene age (35,260-42,900 years) of methane emitted from hotspots along thawing lake margins indicates that this positive feedback to climate warming has led to the release of old carbon stocks previously stored in permafrost.},

abstract = {Terrestrial ecosystems gain carbon through photosynthesis and lose it mostly in the form of carbon dioxide (CO(2)). The extent to which the biosphere can act as a buffer against rising atmospheric CO(2) concentration in global climate change projections remains uncertain at the present stage. Biogeochemical theory predicts that soil nitrogen (N) scarcity may limit natural ecosystem response to elevated CO(2) concentration, diminishing the CO(2)-fertilization effect on terrestrial plant productivity in unmanaged ecosystems. Recent models have incorporated such carbon-nitrogen interactions and suggest that anthropogenic N sources could help sustain the future CO(2)-fertilization effect. However, conclusive demonstration that added N enhances plant productivity in response to CO(2)-fertilization in natural ecosystems remains elusive. Here we manipulated atmospheric CO(2) concentration and soil N availability in a herbaceous brackish wetland where plant community composition is dominated by a C(3) sedge and C(4) grasses, and is capable of responding rapidly to environmental change. We found that N addition enhanced the CO(2)-stimulation of plant productivity in the first year of a multi-year experiment, indicating N-limitation of the CO(2) response. But we also found that N addition strongly promotes the encroachment of C(4) plant species that respond less strongly to elevated CO(2) concentrations. Overall, we found that the observed shift in the plant community composition ultimately suppresses the CO(2)-stimulation of plant productivity by the third and fourth years. Although extensive research has shown that global change factors such as elevated CO(2) concentrations and N pollution affect plant species differently and that they may drive plant community changes, we demonstrate that plant community shifts can act as a feedback effect that alters the whole ecosystem response to elevated CO(2) concentrations. Moreover, we suggest that trade-offs between the abilities of plant taxa to respond positively to different perturbations may constrain natural ecosystem response to global change.},

@article{Johnston2009a,
abstract = {Molecular oxygen (O(2)) began to accumulate in the atmosphere and surface ocean ca. 2,400 million years ago (Ma), but the persistent oxygenation of water masses throughout the oceans developed much later, perhaps beginning as recently as 580-550 Ma. For much of the intervening interval, moderately oxic surface waters lay above an oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) that tended toward euxinia (anoxic and sulfidic). Here we illustrate how contributions to primary production by anoxygenic photoautotrophs (including physiologically versatile cyanobacteria) influenced biogeochemical cycling during Earth's middle age, helping to perpetuate our planet's intermediate redox state by tempering O(2) production. Specifically, the ability to generate organic matter (OM) using sulfide as an electron donor enabled a positive biogeochemical feedback that sustained euxinia in the OMZ. On a geologic time scale, pyrite precipitation and burial governed a second feedback that moderated sulfide availability and water column oxygenation. Thus, we argue that the proportional contribution of anoxygenic photosynthesis to overall primary production would have influenced oceanic redox and the Proterozoic O(2) budget. Later Neoproterozoic collapse of widespread euxinia and a concomitant return to ferruginous (anoxic and Fe(2+) rich) subsurface waters set in motion Earth's transition from its prokaryote-dominated middle age, removing a physiological barrier to eukaryotic diversification (sulfide) and establishing, for the first time in Earth's history, complete dominance of oxygenic photosynthesis in the oceans. This paved the way for the further oxygenation of the oceans and atmosphere and, ultimately, the evolution of complex multicellular organisms.},

abstract = {Surface coal mining is the dominant form of land cover change in Central Appalachia, yet the extent to which surface coal mine runoff is polluting regional rivers is currently unknown. We mapped surface mining from 1976 to 2005 for a 19,581 km(2) area of southern West Virginia and linked these maps with water quality and biological data for 223 streams. The extent of surface mining within catchments is highly correlated with the ionic strength and sulfate concentrations of receiving streams. Generalized additive models were used to estimate the amount of watershed mining, stream ionic strength, or sulfate concentrations beyond which biological impairment (based on state biocriteria) is likely. We find this threshold is reached once surface coal mines occupy {\textgreater}5.4{\%} of their contributing watershed area, ionic strength exceeds 308 $\mu$S cm(-1), or sulfate concentrations exceed 50 mg L(-1). Significant losses of many intolerant macroinvertebrate taxa occur when as little as 2.2{\%} of contributing catchments are mined. As of 2005, 5{\%} of the land area of southern WV was converted to surface mines, 6{\%} of regional streams were buried in valley fills, and 22{\%} of the regional stream network length drained watersheds with {\textgreater}5.4{\%} of their surface area converted to mines.},

abstract = {There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

abstract = {Surface coal mining in Appalachia has caused extensive replacement of forest with non-forested land cover, much of which is unmanaged and unproductive. Although forested ecosystems are valued by society for both marketable products and ecosystem services, forests have not been restored on most Appalachian mined lands because traditional reclamation practices, encouraged by regulatory policies, created conditions poorly suited for reforestation. Reclamation scientists have studied productive forests growing on older mine sites, established forest vegetation experimentally on recent mines, and identified mine reclamation practices that encourage forest vegetation re-establishment. Based on these findings, they developed a Forestry Reclamation Approach (FRA) that can be employed by coal mining firms to restore forest vegetation. Scientists and mine regulators, working collaboratively, have communicated the FRA to the coal industry and to regulatory enforcement personnel. Today, the FRA is used routinely by many coal mining firms, and thousands of mined hectares have been reclaimed to restore productive mine soils and planted with native forest trees. Reclamation of coal mines using the FRA is expected to restore these lands' capabilities to provide forest-based ecosystem services, such as wood production, atmospheric carbon sequestration, wildlife habitat, watershed protection, and water quality protection to a greater extent than conventional reclamation practices.},

@article{Roach2011,
abstract = {The Indian Bend Wash (IBW) flood-control project relies on a greenbelt to carry floods through Scottsdale, Arizona, USA. The greenbelt is characterized by a chain of shallow artificial lakes in a larger floodplain of irrigated turf, which has been protected from encroaching urban development. As such, this urban stream-floodplain complex can be divided into three subsystems: artificial lakes, channelized stream segments, and floodplain. We conducted experiments to evaluate which, if any, of these subsystems were important sites of denitrification, and to explore factors controlling denitrification rates. Denitrification enzyme activity (DEA) bioassays were conducted on sediments from eight lake and six stream segments as well as soil samples from eight floodplain transects. Mass-specific potential denitrification rates were significantly higher in lakes than in streams or floodplains. Nutrient limitation bioassays revealed that nitrate (NO3-) limited denitrification in lake sediments, a surprising finding given that NO3(-)-rich groundwater additions frequently raised lake NO3(-) concentration above 1 mg N/L. Experiments on intact lake cores suggested that denitrification was limited by the rate NO3(-) diffused into sediments, rather than its availability in overlying water. Floodplain denitrification was limited by water content, not NO3(-) or C, and irrigation of soils stimulated denitrification. We constructed a N budget for the IBW stream-floodplain complex based on our experimental results. We found that both lakes and floodplains removed large quantities of N, with denitrification removing 261 and 133 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) from lake sediments and floodplain soils, respectively, indicating that lakes are hotspots for denitrification. Nevertheless, because floodplain area was {\textgreater}4.5 times that of lakes, floodplain soils removed nearly 2.5 times as much N as lake sediments. Given the desert's low annual precipitation, a finding that floodplain soils are active sites of denitrification might seem implausible; however, irrigation is common in urban landscapes, and it elevated annual denitrification in IBW. Based on our results, we conclude that construction of artificial lakes created hotspots while application of irrigation water created hot moments for denitrification in the stream-floodplain complex, demonstrating that management decisions can improve the ability of urban streams to provide critical ecosystem services like N retention.},

@article{Thompson2006a,
abstract = {In the 1930s, after only three years of scientific investigation at the University of Michigan Institute for Fisheries Research, cheap labor and government-sponsored conservation projects spearheaded by the Civilian Conservation Corps allowed the widespread adoption of in-stream structures throughout the United States. From the 1940s through the 1970s, designs of in-stream structures remained essentially unchanged, and their use continued. Despite a large investment in the construction of in-stream structures over these four decades, very few studies were undertaken to evaluate the impacts of the structures on the channel and its aquatic populations. The studies that were undertaken to evaluate the impact of the structures were often flawed. The use of habitat structures became an "accepted practice," however, and early evaluation studies were used as proof that the structures were beneficial to aquatic organisms. A review of the literature reveals that, despite published claims to the contrary, little evidence of the successful use of in-stream structures to improve fish populations exists prior to 1980. A total of 79 publications were checked, and 215 statistical analyses were performed. Only seven analyses provide evidence for a benefit of structures on fish populations, and five of these analyses are suspect because data were misclassified by the original authors. Many of the changes in population measures reported in early publications appear to result from changes in fishing pressure that often accompanied channel modifications. Modern evaluations of channel-restoration projects must consider the influence of fishing pressure to ensure that efforts to improve fish habitat achieve the benefits intended. My statistical results show that the traditional use of in-stream structures for channel restoration design does not ensure demonstrable benefits for fish communities, and their ability to increase fish populations should not be presumed.},

abstract = {Many ecosystems are rapidly being transformed into new, non-historical configurations owing to a variety of local and global changes. We discuss how new systems can arise in the face of primarily biotic change (extinction and/or invasion), primarily abiotic change (e.g. land use or climate change) and a combination of both. Some changes will result in hybrid systems retaining some original characteristics as well as novel elements, whereas larger changes will result in novel systems, which comprise different species, interactions and functions. We suggest that these novel systems will require significant revision of conservation and restoration norms and practices away from the traditional place-based focus on existing or historical assemblages.},

@article{Walker2004a,
abstract = {The concept of resilience has evolved considerably since Holling's (1973) seminal paper. Different interpretations of what is meant by resilience, however, cause confusion. Resilience of a system needs to be considered in terms of the attributes that govern the system's dynamics. Three related attributes of social-ecological systems (SESs) determine their future trajectories: resilience, adaptability, and transformability. Resilience (the capacity of a system to absorb disturbance and reorganize while undergoing change so as to still retain essentially the same function, structure, identity, and feedbacks) has four components-latitude, resistance, precariousness, and panarchy-most readily portrayed using the metaphor of a stability landscape. Adaptability is the capacity of actors in the system to influence resilience (in a SES, essentially to manage it). There are four general ways in which this can be done, corresponding to the four aspects of resilience. Transformability is the capacity to create a fundamentally new system when ecological, economic, or social structures make the existing system untenable. The implications of this interpretation of SES dynamics for sustainability science include changing the focus from seeking optimal states and the determinants of maximum sustainable yield (the MSY paradigm), to resilience analysis, adaptive resource management, and adaptive governance.},

@article{Crimmins2011,
abstract = {Uphill shifts of species' distributions in response to historical warming are well documented, which leads to widespread expectations of continued uphill shifts under future warming. Conversely, downhill shifts are often considered anomalous and unrelated to climate change. By comparing the altitudinal distributions of 64 plant species between the 1930s and the present day within California, we show that climate changes have resulted in a significant downward shift in species' optimum elevations. This downhill shift is counter to what would be expected given 20th-century warming but is readily explained by species' niche tracking of regional changes in climatic water balance rather than temperature. Similar downhill shifts can be expected to occur where future climate change scenarios project increases in water availability that outpace evaporative demand.},

@article{Kaschner2011,
abstract = {Quantifying the spatial distribution of taxa is an important prerequisite for the preservation of biodiversity, and can provide a baseline against which to measure the impacts of climate change. Here we analyse patterns of marine mammal species richness based on predictions of global distributional ranges for 115 species, including all extant pinnipeds and cetaceans. We used an environmental suitability model specifically designed to address the paucity of distributional data for many marine mammal species. We generated richness patterns by overlaying predicted distributions for all species; these were then validated against sightings data from dedicated long-term surveys in the Eastern Tropical Pacific, the Northeast Atlantic and the Southern Ocean. Model outputs correlated well with empirically observed patterns of biodiversity in all three survey regions. Marine mammal richness was predicted to be highest in temperate waters of both hemispheres with distinct hotspots around New Zealand, Japan, Baja California, the Galapagos Islands, the Southeast Pacific, and the Southern Ocean. We then applied our model to explore potential changes in biodiversity under future perturbations of environmental conditions. Forward projections of biodiversity using an intermediate Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) temperature scenario predicted that projected ocean warming and changes in sea ice cover until 2050 may have moderate effects on the spatial patterns of marine mammal richness. Increases in cetacean richness were predicted above 40° latitude in both hemispheres, while decreases in both pinniped and cetacean richness were expected at lower latitudes. Our results show how species distribution models can be applied to explore broad patterns of marine biodiversity worldwide for taxa for which limited distributional data are available.},

Although most of these compounds are present at low concentrations, many of them raise considerable toxicological concerns, particularly when present as components of complex mixtures. Here we review three scientific challenges in addressing water-quality problems caused by such micropollutants. First, tools to assess the impact of these pollutants on aquatic life and human health must be further developed and refined. Second, cost-effective and appropriate remediation and water-treatment technologies must be explored and implemented. Third, usage and disposal strategies, coupled with the search for environmentally more benign products and processes, should aim to minimize introduction of critical pollutants into the aquatic environment.},

abstract = {The collapse of the World Trade Center Towers on September 11, 2001, sent dust and debris across much of Manhattan and in the surrounding areas. Indoor and outdoor dust samples were collected and characterized by U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) scientists using scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive spectrometry (SEM/EDS). From this characterization, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and USGS developed a particulate screening method to determine the presence of residual World Trade Center dust in the indoor environment using slag wool as a primary "signature". The method describes a procedure that includes splitting, ashing, and sieving of collected dust From one split, a 10 mg/mL dust/isopropanol suspension was prepared and 10-30 microL aliquots of the suspension placed on an SEM substrate. Analyses were performed using SEM/EDS manual point counting for slag wool fibers. Poisson regression was used to identify some of the sources of uncertainty, which are directly related to the small number of fibers present on each sample stub. Preliminary results indicate that the procedure is promising for screening urban background dust for the presence of WTC dust. Consistent sample preparation of reference materials and samples must be performed by each laboratory wishing to use this method to obtain meaningful and accurate results.},

@article{Golub2001a,
abstract = {The rationale for this issue, dedicated to the non-antimicrobial activities of tetracyclines (TCs) as matrix metalloproteinase (and cytokine) - inhibitors, and clinical applications of these properties, is addressed in this introduction. From a historical perspective, the author describes two "breakthrough" experiments that opened this field: (1) the discovery of animal collagenase, the first of a series of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) which are now known to be essential mediators of collagen-and connective tissue-destruction including bone loss during various diseases; and (2) the discovery by the author and his team of the unexpected ability of TCs to inhibit these MMPs, and by mechanisms unrelated to the antibiotic activity of these drugs. This led to the development of (i) non-antimicrobial formulations of TCs, ie., sub-antimicrobial-dose doxycycline which resulted in two approved drugs, one for the treatment of periodontal disease, the other for a chronic inflammatory skin disease, and (ii) non-antimicrobial compositions of TCs, ie., the chemically-modified TCs or CMTs or COLs--one of which has shown evidence of efficacy as an anti-angiogenesis agent in human clinical trials on a type of cancer. The development of the CMTs also resulted in the identification of the active site of the TC molecule as an MMP-inhibitor, the calcium and zinc binding site at carbon-11 and 12. And finally, the recently recognized importance of not excessively inhibiting the MMPs because basal levels are needed for various physiologic functions, and the therapeutic potential of TCs as inhibitors of intracellular not just extracellular MMP activity, are both introduced.},
